When this book was first published, the original manuscript\\nwas, unfortunately, cut short to less th an 400 pages, without illustrations and\\nwithout explanations for most of  the original verses of the Çrémad\\nBhagavad-gétä.  In all of my other books— Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Çré Éçopaniñad,\\netc.—the system is that I give the orig inal verse, its English transliteration,\\nword-for-word Sanskrit-English equivalents, translations and purpo rts. This\\nmakes the book very authentic and scholarly and makes the meaning\\nself-evident. I was not very happy, th erefore, when I had to minimize my\\noriginal manuscript. But later on, when the demand for Bhagavad-gétä As It Is\\nconsiderably increased, I was  requested by many scholars and devotees to\\npresent the book in its original form. Th us the present attempt is to offer the\\noriginal manuscript of this great book of knowledge with full paramparä\\nexplanation in order to establish the Kåñëa consciousness mo vement more\\nsoundly and progressively.\\nOur Kåñëa consciousness movement is genuine, historically authorized,\\nnatural and transcendental due to its being based on Bhagavad-gétä As It Is.  It\\nis gradually becoming the most popu lar movement in the entire world,\\nespecially amongst the younger genera tion. It is becoming more and more\\ninteresting to the older generation also. Older gentlemen are becoming\\ninterested, so much so that the father s and grandfathers of my disciples are\\nencouraging us by becoming life members of our great society, the\\nInterna tional Society for Krishna Consciousness. In Los Angeles many fathers\\nand mothers used to come to see me to express their feelings of gratitude for\\nmy leading the Kåñëa consciousness movement throughout the entire world.\\nSome of them said that it is greatl y fortunate for the Americans that I have\\nstarted the Kåñëa consciousness moveme nt in America. But actually theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.original father of this movement is Lo rd Kåñëa Himself, since it was started a\\nvery long time ago but is coming down to human society by discipl ic\\nsuccession. If I have any credit in this  connection, it does not belong to me\\npersonally, but it is due to my eterna l spiritual master, His Divine Grace Oà\\nViñëupäda Paramahaàsa Parivräjakäcärya 108 Çré Çrémad Bhaktisiddhänta\\nSarasvaté Gosvämé Mahäräja Prabhupäda.\\nIf personally I have any credit in this  matter, it is only that I have tried to\\npresent Bhagavad-gétä  as it is, without any adulteration. Before my\\npresentation of Bhagavad-gétä As It Is,  almost all the English editions of\\nBhagavad-gétä  were introduced to fulfill someone’s personal ambition. But our\\nattempt, in presenting Bhagavad-gétä As It Is,  is to present the mission of the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa.  Our business is to present the will of\\nKåñëa, not that of any mundane speculator like the po litician, philosopher or\\nscientist, for they have very little kno wledge of Kåñëa, despite all their other\\nknowledge. When Kåñëa says, man-manä bhava mad-bhakto mad-yäjé mäà\\nnamaskuru  [Bg. 18.65 ], etc., we, unlike the so-called scholars, do not say that\\nKåñëa and His inner spirit are different . Kåñëa is absolute, and there is no\\ndifference between Kåñëa’s name, Kåñëa’ s form, Kåñëa’s qualities, Kåñëa’s\\npastimes, etc. This absolute position of Kåñëa is difficult to understand for any\\nperson who is not a devote e of Kåñëa in the system of paramparä  (disciplic\\nsuccession). Generally the so-called scholars, politicians, philosophers, and\\nsvämés,  without perfect knowledge of Kåñëa, try to banish or kill Kåñëa when\\nwriting commentary on Bhagavad-gétä.  Such unauthoriz ed commentary upon\\nBhagavad-gétä  is known as Mäyäväda-bhäñya,  and Lord Caitanya has warned us\\nabout these unauthorized men. Lord C aitanya clearly says that anyone who\\ntries to understand Bhagavad-gétä  f r o m  t h e  M ä y ä v ä d é  p o i n t  o f  v i e w  w i l l\\ncommit a great blu nder. The result of such a blun der will be that the misguided\\nstudent of Bhagavad-gétä  will certainly be bewildered on the path of spiritual\\nguidance and will not be able to go back to home, back to Godhead.\\nOur only purpose is to present this Bhagavad-gétä As It Is  in order to guide\\nthe conditioned student to the same pu rpose for which Kåñëa descends to this\\nplanet once in a day of Brahmä, or every 8,600,000,000 years. This purpose is\\nstated in Bhagavad-gétä,  and we have to accept it as  it is; otherwise there is noCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.point in trying to understand the Bhagavad-gétä  and its speaker, Lord Kåñëa.\\nLord Kåñëa first spoke Bhagavad-gétä  to the sun-god some hundreds of millions\\no f  y e a r s  a g o .  W e  h a v e  t o  a c c e p t  t h i s  f a c t  a nd thus understand the historical\\nsignificance of Bhagavad-gétä,  without misinterpretation, on the authority of\\nKåñëa. To interpret Bhagavad-gétä  without any reference to the will of Kåñëa is\\nthe greatest offense. In order to save oneself from this offense , one has to\\nunderstand the Lord as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as He was\\ndirectly understood by Arjuna, Lord Kå ñëa’s first disciple. Such understanding\\nof Bhagavad-gétä  is really profitable and authorized for the welfare of human\\nsociety in fulfil ling the mission of life.\\nThe Kåñëa consciousness movement is essential in human society, for it\\noffers the highest perfection of life. Ho w this is so is explained fully in the\\nBhagavad-gétä.  Unfortunately, mundane wranglers have taken advantage of\\nBhagavad-gétä  to push forward the ir demonic propensities and mislead people\\nregarding right understanding of the simp le principles of life. Everyone should\\nk n o w  h o w  G o d ,  o r  K å ñ ë a ,  i s  g r e a t ,  and everyone should know the factual\\nposition of the living entities. Everyone should know that a l iving entity is\\neternally a servant and that unless one serves Kåñëa one has to serve illusion\\nin different varieties of the three modes of material nature and thus wander\\nperpetually within the cycle of birth an d death; even the so-called liberated\\nMäyävä dé speculator has to undergo this pr ocess. This knowledge constitutes a\\ngreat science, and each and every living being has to hear it for his own\\ninterest.\\nPeople in general, especially in this Age of Kali, are enamored by the\\nexternal energy of Kåñëa, and they wrongly think that by advancement of\\nmaterial comforts every man will be ha ppy. They have no knowledge that the\\nmaterial or external nature is very st rong, for everyone is strongly bound by\\nthe stringent laws of material nature. A living entity is happily the part and\\nparcel of the Lord, and thus his natural function is to render immediate service\\nto the Lord. By the spell of illusion one tries to be ha ppy by serving his\\npersonal sense gratification in different forms which will never make him\\nhappy. Instead of satisfying his own personal material senses, he has to satisfy\\nthe senses of the Lord. That is the high est perfection of life. The Lord wantsCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.this, and He demands it. One has to understand this central point of\\nBhagavad-gétä.  Our Kåñëa consciousness movement is teaching the whole\\nworld this central point, and becaus e we are not polluting the theme of\\nBhagavad-gétä As It Is,  anyone seriously interes ted in deriving benefit by\\nstudying the Bhagavad-gétä  must take help from the Kåñëa consciousness\\nmovement for practical understanding of Bhagavad-gétä  under the direct\\nguidance of the Lord. We hope, therefore, that people will derive the greatest\\nbenefit by studying Bhagavad-gétä As It Is  as we have presented it here, and if\\neven one man becomes a pure devotee of the Lord, we shall consider our\\nattempt a success.\\nA.

It is the essence of Vedic\\nknowledge and one of the most important Upaniñads  in Vedic literature. Of\\ncourse there are many commentaries in English on the Bhagavad-gétä,  and one\\nmay question the necessity for anot her one. This present edition can be\\nexplained in the following way. Rece ntly an American lady asked me to\\nrecommend an English translation of Bhagavad-gétä.  Of course in America\\nthere are so many editions of Bhagavad-gétä  available in English, but as far as I\\nhave seen, not only in America but also in India, none of them can be strictly\\nsaid to be authoritative because in al most every one of them the commentator\\nhas expressed his own opinions without touching the spirit of Bhagavad-gétä  as\\nit is.\\nThe spirit of Bhagavad-gétä  is mentioned in Bhagavad-gétä  itself. It is just\\nlike this: If we want to take a particul ar medicine, then we have to follow the\\ndirections written on the label. We ca nnot take the medicine according to our\\nown whim or the direc tion of a friend. It must be taken according to the\\ndirections on the label or the directions given by a physician. Similarly,\\nBhagavad-gétä  s h o u l d  b e  t a k e n  o r  a c c e p t e d  a s  i t  i s  d i r e c t e d  b y  t h e  s p e a k e r\\nHimself. The speaker of Bhagavad-gétä  is Lord Çré Kåñë a. He is mentioned onCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.every page of Bhagavad-gétä  as the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\\nBhagavän. Of course the word bhagavän  sometimes refers to any powerful\\nperson or any powerful demigod, and certainly here bhagavän  designates Lord\\nÇré Kåñëa as a great  personality, but at the same time we should know that\\nLord Çré Kåñëa is the Supreme Personalit y of Godhead, as is confirmed by all\\ngreat äcäryas  (spiritual masters) like Çaìkaräcärya, Rämänujäcärya,\\nMadhväcärya, Nimbärka Svämé, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu and  many other\\nauthorities of Vedic knowledge in Ind ia. The Lord Himself also establishes\\nHimself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the Bhagavad-gétä,  and He\\nis accepted as such in the Brahma-saàhitä  and all the Puräëas,  especially the\\nÇrémad-Bhägavata m, known as the Bhägavata Puräëa  (kåñëas tu bhagavän\\nsvayam ). Therefore we should take Bhagavad-gétä  as it is directed by the\\nPersonality of Godhead Himself. In the Fourth Chapter of the Gétä (4.1–3 ) the\\nLord says:\\nimaà vivasvate yogaà\\nproktavän aham avyayam\\nvivasvän manave präha\\nmanur ikñväkave ’bravét\\n [Bg. 4.1]\\nevaà paramparä-präptam\\nimaà räjarñayo viduù\\nsa käleneha mahatä\\nyogo nañöaù parantapa\\n [Bg. 4.2]\\nsa eväyaà mayä te ’dya\\nyogaù proktaù purätanaù\\nbhakto ’si me sakhä ceti\\nrahasyaà hy etad uttamam\\n [Bg. 4.3]\\nHere the Lord informs Arjuna that this system of yoga,  the Bhagavad-gétä,\\nwas first spoken to the sun-god, and the sun-god explained it to Manu, andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Manu explained it to Ikñväku, and in that way, by disciplic succession, one\\nspeaker after another, this yoga system has been coming down. But in the\\ncourse of time it has become lost. Cons equently the Lord has to speak it again,\\nthis time to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra.\\nHe tells Arjuna that He is relating  this supreme secret to him because\\nArjuna is His devotee and His frie nd. The purport of this is that Bhagavad-gétä\\nis a treatise which is especially mean t for the devotee of the Lord. There are\\nthree classes of transcend entalists, namely the jïäné,  the yogé and the bhakta,\\nor the impersonalist, the meditator and the devotee. Here the Lord clearly tells\\nArjuna that He is making him the first receiver of a new paramparä  (disciplic\\nsuccession) because the old succession was broken. It was the Lord’s wish,\\ntherefore, to establish another paramparä  in the same line of thought that was\\ncoming down from the sun-god to others , and it was His wish that His teaching\\nbe distributed anew by Arjuna. He wanted Arjuna to become the autho rity in\\nunderstanding the Bhagavad-gétä.  So we see that Bhagavad-gétä  is instructed to\\nArjuna especially because Arjuna was a devotee of the Lord, a direct student\\nof Kåñëa, and His intimate friend. Therefore Bhagavad-gétä  is best understood\\nby a person wh o has qualities similar to Arjuna’s. That is to say he must be a\\ndevotee in a direct relationship with  the Lord. As soon as one becomes a\\ndevotee of the Lord, he also has a direct  relationship with the Lord. That is a\\nvery elaborate subject matter, but bri efly it can be stated that a devotee is in a\\nrelationship with the Supreme Personalit y of Godhead in one of five different\\nways:\\n1. One may be a devotee in a passive state;\\n2. One may be a devotee in an active state;\\n3. One may be a devotee as a friend;\\n4. One may be a devotee as a parent;\\n5. One may be a devotee as a conjugal lover.\\nArjuna was in a relationship with the Lord as friend. Of course there is a\\ngulf of difference between this friendship and the friendship found in the\\nmaterial world. This is transcendent al friendship, which cannot be had by\\neveryone. Of course everyone has  a particular relationship with the Lord, andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.that relationship is evoked by the perfec tion of devotional service. But in the\\npresent status of our life, not only ha ve we forgotten the Supreme Lord, but we\\nhave forgotten our eternal relationship with the L ord. Every living being, out\\nof the many, many billions and trillions of living beings, has a particular\\nrelationship with the Lord eternally. That is called svarüpa.  By the process of\\ndevotional service, one can revive that svarüpa,  and that stage is call ed\\nsvarüpa-siddhi —perfection of one’s constitutional position. So Arjuna was a\\ndevotee, and he was in touch with the Supreme Lord in friendship.\\nHow Arjuna accepted this Bhagavad-gétä  should be noted. His manner of\\nacceptance is given in the Tenth Chapter ( 10.12–14 ):\\narjuna uväca\\nparaà brahma paraà dhäma\\npavitraà paramaà bhavän\\npuruñaà çäçvataà divyam\\nädi-devam ajaà vibhum\\nähus tväm åñayaù sarve\\ndevarñir näradas tathä\\nasito devalo vyäsaù\\nsvayaà caiva bravéñi me\\nsarvam etad åtaà manye\\nyan mäà vadasi keçava\\nna hi te bhagavan vyaktià\\nvidur devä na dänaväù\\n“Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Pe rsonality of Godhead, the ultimate\\nabode, the purest, the Absolute Truth. You are the eternal, transcendental,\\noriginal person, the unborn, the greatest. All the great sages such as Närada,\\nAsita, Devala, and Vyäsa confi rm this truth about You, and now You Yourself\\nare declaring it to me. O Kåñëa, I totally accept as truth all that You have told\\nme. Neither the demigods nor the demons, O Lord, can understand Your\\npersonality.”\\nAfter hearing Bhagavad-gétä  from the Supreme Personality of Godhead,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Arjuna accepted Kåñëa as paraà brahma,  the Supreme Brahman. Every living\\nbeing is Brahman, but the supreme living  being, or the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead, is the Supreme Brahman. Paraà dhäma  means that He is the\\nsupreme rest or abode of everything; pavitram  means that He is pure, untainted\\nby material contamination; puruñam  means that He is the supreme enjoyer;\\nçäçvatam,  original; divyam,  transcendental; ädi-devam,  the Supreme Persona lity\\nof Godhead; ajam,  the unborn; and vibhum,  the greatest.\\nNow one may think that because Kåñëa was the friend of Arjuna, Arjuna\\nwas telling Him all this by way of flattery, but Arjuna, just to drive out this\\nkind of doubt from the minds of the readers of Bhagavad-gétä,  substantiates\\nthese praises in the next vers e when he says that Kåñëa is accepted as the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead not only  by himself but by authorities like\\nNärada, Asita, Devala and Vyäsadeva.  These are great personalities who\\ndistribute the Vedic knowledge as it is accepted by all äcäryas.  Therefore\\nArjuna tells Kåñëa that he accepts whatever He says to be completely perfect.\\nSarvam etad åtaà manye : “I accept everything You say to be true.” Arjuna also\\nsays that the personality of the Lord is very difficult to understand and that He\\ncannot b e known even by the great demi gods. This means that the Lord\\ncannot even be known by personalities greater than human beings. So how\\ncan a human being understand Lord Çré Kåñëa without becoming His devotee?\\nTherefore Bhagavad-gétä  should be taken up in a spirit of devotion. One\\nshould not think that he is equal to Kå ñëa, nor should he think that Kåñëa is\\nan ordinary personality or even a very great personality. Lord Çré Kåñëa is the\\nSupreme Personality of God head. So according to the statements of\\nBhagavad-gétä  or the statements of Arjuna , the person who is trying to\\nunderstand the Bhagavad-gétä,  we should at least theoretically accept Çré Kåñëa\\nas the Supreme Personality of Godh ead, and with that submissive s pirit we can\\nunderstand the Bhagavad-gétä.  Unless one reads the Bhagavad-gétä  in a\\nsubmissive spirit, it is very difficult to understand Bhagavad-gétä,  because it is a\\ngreat mystery.\\nJust what is the Bhagavad-gétä ? The purpose of Bhagavad-gétä  is to deliver\\nmankind from the nescience of material existence. Every man is in difficulty\\nin so many ways, as Arjuna also was in  difficulty in having to fight the BattleCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.of Kurukñetra. Arjuna su rrendered unto Çré Kåñëa, and consequently this\\nBhagavad-gétä  was spoken. Not only Arjuna, but every one of us is full of\\nanxieties because of this material exis tence. Our very existence is in the\\natmosphere of nonexistence. Actually we are not meant to be  threatened by\\nnonexistence. Our existence is eternal. But somehow or other we are put into\\nasat.  Asat  refers to that which does not exist.\\nOut of so many human beings who are suffering, there are a few who are\\nactually inquiring about their position, as  to what they are, why they are put\\ninto this awkward position and so on. Unless one is awakened to this position\\nof questioning his suffering , unless he realizes that he doesn’t want suffering\\nbut rather wants to make a solution to  all suffering, then one is not to be\\nconsidered a perfect human being. Humanity begins when this sort of inquiry\\nis awakened in one’s mind. In the Brahma-sütra  this inquiry is called brahma\\njijïäsä.  Athäto brahma jijïäsä . Every activity of the human being is to be\\nconsidered a failure unless he inquires about the nature of the Absolute.\\nTherefore those who begin to question why they are suffering or where they\\ncame fr om and where they shall go afte r death are proper students for\\nunderstanding Bhagavad-gétä.  The sincere student should also have a firm\\nrespect for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a student was Arjuna.\\nLord Kåñëa descends specifically to reestablish the real purpose of life when\\nman forgets that purpose. Even then, out of many, many human beings who\\nawaken, there may be one who actually en ters the spirit of understanding his\\nposition, and for him this Bhagavad-gétä  is spoken. Actually we are all\\nswallowed by the tigress of nescience, bu t the Lord is very merciful upon living\\nentities, especially human beings. To this end He spoke the Bhagavad-gétä,\\nmaking His friend Arjuna His student.\\nBeing an associate of Lord Kåñëa, Arjuna was above all ignorance, but\\nArjuna was put into ignorance on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra just to\\nquestion Lord Kåñëa about the problems of life so that the Lord could explain\\nthem for the benefit of future genera tions of human beings and chalk out the\\nplan of life. Then man could act accordingly and perfect the mission of human\\nlife.\\nThe subject of the Bhagavad-gétä  entails the comprehension of five basicCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.truths. First of all, the science of God is explained and then the constitutional\\nposition of the living entities, jévas.  There is éçvara,  which means the\\ncontroller, and there are jévas, the living entities which are controlled. If a\\nliving entity says that he is not controlled but that he is free, then he is insane.\\nThe living being is controlled in every re spect, at least in his conditioned life.\\nSo in the Bhagavad-gétä  the subject matter deals with the éçvara,  the supreme\\ncontroller, and the jévas,  the controlled living entities. Prakåti (material\\nnature) and time (the duration of ex istence of the whole universe or the\\nmanifestation of material nature) and karma  (activity) are also discussed. The\\ncosmic manifestation is full of different  activities. All living entities are\\nengaged in different activities. From Bhagavad-gétä  we must learn what God is,\\nwhat the living entities are, what prakåti  is, what the cosmic manifestation is,\\nhow it is controlled by time, and what the activities of the living entities are.\\nOut of these five basic subject matters in Bhagavad-gétä  it is established that\\nthe Supreme Godhead, or Kåñëa, or Brahman, or the supreme controller, or\\nParamätmä—you may use whatever name yo u like—is the greatest of all. The\\nliving beings are in quality l ike the supreme controller. For instance, the Lord\\nhas control over the universal affairs of material nature, as will be explained in\\nthe later chapters of Bhagavad-gétä.  Material nature is not independent. She is\\nacting under the directions of the Supreme  Lord. As Lord Kåñëa says,\\nmayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate sa-caräcaram : “This material nature is working\\nunder My direction.” When we see wond erful things happening in the cosmic\\nnature, we should know that behind this cosmic manifestation there is a\\ncontro ller. Nothing could be manifested with out being controlled. It is childish\\nnot to consider the controller. For instance, a child may think that an\\nautomobile is quite wonderful to be able  to run without a horse or other animal\\npulling it, but a sane man kn ows the nature of the automobile’s engineering\\narrangement. He always knows that behind the machinery there is a man, a\\ndriver. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the driver under whose direction\\neverything is working. Now the jévas,  or the living entities, ha ve been accepted\\nby the Lord, as we will note in the later chapters, as His parts and parcels. A\\nparticle of gold is also gold, a drop of water from the ocean is also salty, and\\nsimilarly we the living entities, be ing part and parcel of the supremeCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.control ler, éçvara,  or Bhagavän, Lord Çré Kåñëa, have all the qualities of the\\nSupreme Lord in minute quantity because we are minute éçvaras,  subordinate\\néçvaras.  We are trying to control nature, as presently we are trying to control\\nspace or planets, and this te ndency to control is there because it is in Kåñëa.\\nBut although we have a tendency to lord it over material nature, we should\\nknow that we are not the suprem e controller. This is explained in\\nBhagavad-gétä.\\nWhat is material nature? This is also explained in Gétä as inferior prakåti,\\ninferior nature. The living entity  is explained as the superior prakåti.  Prakåti  is\\nalways under control, whether inferior or superior. Prakåti  is female, and she is\\ncontrolled by  the Lord just as the activities  of a wife are controlled by the\\nhusband. Prakåti  is always subordinate, predominated by the Lord, who is the\\npredominator. The living entities and ma terial nature are both predominated,\\ncontrolled by the Supreme Lord. Accor ding to the Gétä,  the living entities,\\nalthough parts and parcels of the Su preme Lord, are to be considered prakåti.\\nThis is clearly mentioned in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä.  Apareyam\\nitas tv anyäà prakåtià viddhi me paräm/ jéva-bhütäm : “This mate rial nature is\\nMy inferior prakåti,  but beyond this is another prakåti—jéva-bhütäm,  the living\\nentity.”\\nMaterial nature itself is constituted by three qualities: the mode of\\ngoodness, the mode of passion and the mode of ignorance. Above these modes\\nthere is eternal time, and by a combinat ion of these modes of nature and under\\nthe control and purview of etern al time there are activities, which are called\\nkarma.  These activities are being carried out from time immemorial, and we\\nare suffering or enjoying the fruits of our activities. For instance, suppose I am\\na businessman and have worked very hard with intell igence and have amassed\\na great bank balance. Then I am an en joyer. But then say I have lost all my\\nmoney in business; then I am a sufferer. Similarly, in every field of life we\\nenjoy the results of our work, or we suffer the results. This is called karma.\\nÉçvara (the Supreme Lord), jéva (the living entity), prakåti  (nature), käla\\n(eternal time) and karma  (activity) are all explained in the Bhagavad-gétä.  Out\\nof these five, the Lord, the living entiti es, material nature and time are eternal.\\nThe manifestatio n of prakåti  may be temporary, but it is not false. SomeCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.philosophers say that the manifestatio n of material nature is false, but\\naccording to the philosophy of Bhagavad-gétä  or according to the philosophy of\\nthe Vaiñëavas, this is not so. The manifestatio n of the world is not accepted as\\nfalse; it is accepted as real, but temporary. It is likened unto a cloud which\\nmoves across the sky, or the coming of the rainy season, which nourishes\\ngrains. As soon as the rainy season is over and as soon as the cloud g oes away,\\nall the crops which were nourished by the rain dry up. Similarly, this material\\nmanifestation takes place at a certain  interval, stays for a while and then\\ndisappears. Such are the workings of prakåti.  But this cycle is working\\neternally. Therefo re prakåti  is eternal; it is not false. The Lord refers to this as\\n“My prakåti. ” This material nature is the separated energy of the Supreme\\nLord, and similarly the living entities are also the energy of the Supreme Lord,\\nalthough they are not separated bu t eternally related. So the Lord, the living\\nentity, material nature and time are all interrelated and are all eternal.\\nHowever, the other item, karma,  is not eternal. The effects of karma  may be\\nvery old indeed. We are suffering or enjoying the results of  our activities from\\ntime immemorial, but we can change the results of our karma,  or our activity,\\nand this change depends on the perfection of our knowledge. We are engaged\\nin various activities. Undoubtedly we do  not know what sort of activities we\\nshoul d adopt to gain relief from the action s and reactions of all these activities,\\nbut this is also explained in the Bhagavad-gétä.\\nThe position of éçvara,  the Supreme Lord, is that of supreme consciousness.\\nThe jévas,  or the living entities, being parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord,\\nare also conscious. Both the living entity and material nature are explained as\\nprakåti,  the energy of the Supreme Lord, but one of the two, the jéva, is\\nconscious. The other prakåti  is not conscious. That is the difference. Therefore\\nthe jéva-prakåti  is called superior because the jéva has consciousness which is\\nsimilar to the Lord’s. The Lord’s is supr eme consciousness, however, and one\\nshould not claim that the jéva, the living entity, is also supremely conscious.\\nThe living being cannot be supremely cons cious at any stage of his perfection,\\nand the theory that he can be so is a misleading theory. Cons cious he may be,\\nbut he is not perfectly or supremely conscious.\\nThe distinction between the jéva and the éçvara  will be explained in theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Thirteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä.  The Lord is kñetra-jïa,  conscious, as is\\nthe living being, but the living being is conscious of his particular body,\\nwhereas the Lord is conscious  of all bodies. Because He lives in the heart of\\nevery living being, He is conscious of the psychic movements of the particular\\njévas.  We should not forget this. It is al so explained that the Paramätmä, the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, is living in ever yone’s heart as éçvara,  as the\\ncontroller, and that He is giving directio ns for the living entity to act as he\\ndesires. The living entity forgets what to do. First of all he makes a\\ndetermination to act in a certain way, and then he is entangled in the act ions\\nand reactions of his own karma.  After giving up one type of body, he enters\\nanother type of body, as we put on an d take off clothes. As the soul thus\\nmigrates, he suffers the actions and reactions of his past activities. These\\nactivities can be change d when the living being is in the mode of goodness, in\\nsanity, and understands what sort of activities he should adopt. If he does so,\\nthen all the actions and reactions of his past activities can be changed.\\nConsequently, karma  is not eternal. Therefore w e stated that of the five items\\n(éçvara, jéva, prakåti,  time and karma ) four are eternal, whereas karma  is not\\neternal.\\nThe supreme conscious éçvara  is similar to the living entity in this way: both\\nthe consciousness of the Lord and that of  the living entity are transcendental.\\nIt is not that consciousness is generated by the association of matter. That is a\\nmistaken idea. The theory that consciousness develops under certain\\ncircumstances of material combin ation is not accepted in the Bhagavad-gétä.\\nConsciousness may be pervertedly reflected by the covering of material\\ncircumstances, just as light reflected through colored g lass may appear to be a\\ncertain color, but the consciousness of th e Lord is not materially affected. Lord\\nKåñëa says, mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù  [Bg. 9.10]. When He descends into the\\nmaterial universe, His consciousness is not materially affected. If He were s o\\naffected, He would be unfit to speak on  transcendental matters as He does in\\nthe Bhagavad-gétä.  One cannot say anything about the transcendental world\\nwithout being free from materially contam inated consciousness. So the Lord is\\nnot materially contaminat ed. Our consciousness, at the present moment,\\nhowever, is materially contaminated. The Bhagavad-gétä  teaches that we haveCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.to purify this materially contaminated consciousness. In pure consciousness,\\nour actions will be dovetailed to the will of éçvara,  and that will make us happy.\\nIt is not that we have to cease all ac tivities. Rather, our activities are to be\\npurified, and purified activities are called bhakti.  Activities in bhakti  appear to\\nbe like ordinary activities, but they are not contaminated. An ig norant person\\nmay see that a devotee is acting or work ing like an ordinary man, but such a\\nperson with a poor fund of knowledge does not know that the activities of the\\ndevotee or of the Lord are not cont aminated by impure consciousness or\\nmatter. They are  transcendental to the three modes of nature. We should\\nknow, however, that at this point our consciousness is contaminated.\\nWhen we are materially contaminated , we are called conditioned. False\\nconsciousness is exhibited under the impression that I am a product of material\\nnature. This is called false ego. One wh o is absorbed in the thought of bodily\\nconceptions cannot understa nd his situation. Bhagavad-gétä  was spoken to\\nliberate one from the bodily conception of life, and Arjuna put himself in this\\nposition in order to receive this info rmation from the Lord. One must become\\nfree from the bodily conception of life; that is the preliminary activity for the\\ntranscendentalist. One who wants to become free, who wants to become\\nliberated, must first of all learn that he is not this material body. Mukti,  or\\nliberation, means freedom from material consciousness. In the\\nÇrémad-Bhägavata m also the definition of liberation is given. Muktir\\nhitvänyathä-rüpaà svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù : mukti  means liberation from the\\ncontaminated consciousness of this material world and situation in pure\\nconsciousness. All the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä  are intended to awaken\\nthis pure consciousness, and therefore we find at the last stage of the Gétä’s\\ninstructions that Kåñëa is asking Arjuna whether he is now in purified\\nconsciousness. Purified consciousness means acting in accordance with the\\ninstructions of the Lord. This is the whole sum and substance of purified\\nconsciousness. Consciousness is already there because we are part and parcel of\\nthe Lord, but for us there is the affinity of being affected by the inferior\\nmodes. But the Lord, being the Supreme , is never affected. That is the\\ndifference between the Supreme Lord and the small individual souls.\\nWhat is this consciousness? This cons ciousness is “I am.” Then what am I?Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.In contaminated consciousness “I am” mean s “I am the lord of all I survey. I am\\nthe enjoyer.” The world revolves because every living being thinks that he is\\nthe lord and creator of the material world. Material consciousness has two\\npsychic divisions. One is that I am the creator, and the other is that I am the\\nenjoyer. But actually the Supreme Lord is both the creator and the enjoyer,\\nand the living entity, being part and parcel of t he Supreme Lord, is neither the\\ncreator nor the enjoyer, but a cooperato r. He is the created and the enjoyed.\\nFor instance, a part of a machine cooper ates with the whole machine; a part of\\nthe body cooperates with the whole body. The hands, legs, eyes, and  so on are\\nall parts of the body, but they are not ac tually the enjoyers. The stomach is the\\nenjoyer. The legs move, the hands supply food, the teeth chew, and all parts of\\nthe body are engaged in satisfying th e stomach because the stomach is the\\nprincipal  factor that nourishes the body’s organization. Therefore everything is\\ngiven to the stomach. One nourishes the tree by watering its root, and one\\nnourishes the body by feeding the stomach,  for if the body is to be kept in a\\nhealthy state, then the parts o f the body must cooperate to feed the stomach.\\nSimilarly, the Supreme Lord is th e enjoyer and the creator, and we, as\\nsubordinate living beings, are meant to cooperate to satisfy Him. This\\ncooperation will actually help us, just as food taken by the stomac h will help all\\nother parts of the body. If the fingers of  the hand think that they should take\\nthe food themselves instead of giving it to the stomach, then they will be\\nfrustrated. The central figure of crea tion and of enjoyment is the Supreme\\nLord, and the living entities are cooperators. By cooperation they enjoy. The\\nrelation is also like that of the master  and the servant. If the master is fully\\nsatisfied, then the servant is satisfied.  Similarly, the Supreme Lord should be\\nsatisfied, although the ten dency to become the creator and the tendency to\\nenjoy the material world are there also in the living entities because these\\ntendencies are there in the Supreme Lord who has created the manifested\\ncosmic world.\\nWe shall find, therefore, in this Bhagavad-gétä  that the complete whole is\\ncomprised of the supreme controller, the controlled living entities, the cosmic\\nmanifestation, eternal time and karma,  or activities, and all of these are\\nexplained in this text. Al l of these taken completely form the complete whole,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.and the complete whole is called the Supreme Absolute Truth. The complete\\nwhole and the complete Absolute Tr uth are the complete Personality of\\nGodhead, Çré Kåñëa. All manife stations are due to His diffe rent energies. He is\\nthe complete whole.\\nIt is also explained in the Gétä that impersonal Brahman is also subordinate\\nto the complete Supreme Person ( brahmaëo hi pratiñöhäham ). Brahman is more\\nexplicitly explained in the Brahma-sütra  t o  b e  l i k e  t h e  r a y s  o f  t h e  s u n s h i n e .\\nThe impersonal Brahman is the shining rays of the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead. Impersonal Brahman is incomple te realization of the absolute whole,\\nand so also is the conception of Paramä tmä. In the Fifteenth Chapter it shall\\nbe seen that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Puruñ ottama, is above both\\nimpersonal Brahman and the partial re alization of Paramätmä. The Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead is called sac-cid-änanda-vigraha.  The Brahma-saàhitä\\nbegins in this way: éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù/ anädir ädir\\ngovin daù sarva-käraëa-käraëam . “Govinda, Kåñëa, is the cause of all causes. He\\nis the primal cause, and He is the very  form of eternity, knowledge and bliss.”\\nImpersonal Brahman realization is the realization of His sat (eternity) feature.\\nParamätmä realization  is the realization of sat-cit  (eternal knowledge). But\\nrealization of the Personality of Godhea d, Kåñëa, is realization of all the\\ntranscendental features: sat, cit  and änanda  (eternity, knowledge, and bliss) in\\ncomplete vigraha  (form).\\nPeople with less intelligence consider the Supreme Truth to be impersonal,\\nbut He is a transcendental person, and this is confirmed in all Vedic\\nliteratures. Nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm.  (Kaöha Upaniñad  2.2.13 ) As we\\nare all individual living beings a nd have our individuality, the Supreme\\nAbsolute Truth is also, in the ultimate issue, a person, and realization of the\\nPersonality of Godhead is realization of  all of the transcendental features in\\nHis complete form. The complete whole is not formless. If He is formless, or if\\nHe is less than any other thing, then He cannot be the complete whole. The\\ncomplete whole must have everything within our experience and beyond our\\nexperience, otherwise it cannot be complete.\\nThe complete whole, Personality of Godhead, has immense potencies\\n(paräsya çaktir vividhaiva çrüyate ). How Kåñëa is acting in different potencies isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.also explained in Bhagavad-gétä.  This phenomenal world or material world in\\nwhich we are placed is also com plete in itself because the twenty-four elements\\nof which this material universe is a temporary manifestation, according to\\nSäìkhya philosophy, are completely adju sted to produce complete resources\\nwhich are necessary for the maintenance and subsistence of  this universe.\\nThere is nothing extraneous, nor is ther e anything needed. This manifestation\\nhas its own time fixed by the energy of  the supreme whole, and when its time\\nis complete, these temporary manifestations will be annihilated by the\\ncomplete arran gement of the complete. There is complete facility for the small\\ncomplete units, namely the living entiti es, to realize the complete, and all sorts\\nof incompleteness are experienced due to incomplete knowledge of the\\ncomplete. So Bhagavad-gétä  contains the  complete knowledge of Vedic wisdom.\\nAll Vedic knowledge is infallible, and Hindus accept Vedic knowledge to be\\ncomplete and infallible. For example, cow dung is the stool of an animal, and\\naccording to småti,  or Vedic injunction, if one touches the stool of an animal\\nhe has to take a bath to  purify himself. But in the Vedic scriptures cow dung is\\nconsidered to be a purifying agent. One might consider this to be\\ncontradictory, but it is accepted becaus e it is Vedic injunction, and indeed by\\naccepting this, one will not commit a mistake; subseq uently it has been proved\\nby modern science that cow dung cont ains all antiseptic properties. So Vedic\\nknowledge is complete because it is above all doubts and mistakes, and\\nBhagavad-gétä  is the essence of all Vedic knowledge.\\nVedic knowledge is not a question of research. Our research work is\\nimperfect because we are researching thin gs with imperfect senses. We have to\\naccept perfect knowledge which comes down, as is stated in Bhagavad-gétä,  by\\nthe paramparä  (disciplic successi on). We have to receive knowledge from the\\nproper source in disciplic succession beginning with the supreme spiritual\\nmaster, the Lord Himself, and handed  down to a succession of spiritual\\nmasters. Arjuna, the student who took lessons from Lord Çré Kåñëa, accepts\\neverything that He says without cont radicting Him. One is not allowed to\\naccept one portion of Bhagavad-gétä  and not another. No. We must accept\\nBhagavad-gétä  without interpretation, withou t deletion and without our own\\nwhimsical participation in t he matter. The Gétä should be taken as the mostCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.perfect presentation of Vedic knowledge. Vedic knowledge is received from\\ntranscendental sources, and the first wo rds were spoken by the Lord Himself.\\nThe words spoken by the Lord are called apauruñeya,  meani ng that they are\\ndifferent from words spoken by a person of the mundane world who is infected\\nwith four defects. A mundaner (1) is sure to commit mistakes, (2) is invariably\\nillusioned, (3) has the tendency to cheat others and (4) is limited by imperfect\\nsenses. With these four imperfections, one cannot deliver perfect information\\nof all-pervading knowledge.\\nVedic knowledge is not imparted by su ch defective living entities. It was\\nimparted unto the heart of Brahmä, the first created living being, and Brahmä\\nin his turn disseminated this knowledge to his sons and disciples, as he\\noriginally received it from the  Lord. The Lord is pürëam,  all-perfect, and there\\nis no possibility of His becoming subjected to the laws of material nature. One\\nshould therefore be intelligent enough to know that the Lord is the only\\nproprietor of everything in the universe and that He is the original creator,\\nthe creator of Brahmä. In the Eleven th Chapter the Lord is addressed as\\nprapitämaha  [Bg. 11.39 ] because Brahmä is addressed as pitämaha,  the\\ngrandfather, and He is the creator of the grandfather. So no one should claim\\nto be the pr oprietor of anything; one should accept only things which are set\\naside for him by the Lord as his quota for his maintenance.\\nThere are many examples given of how we are to utilize those things which\\nare set aside for us by the Lord. This is also explained in Bhagavad-gétä.  In the\\nbeginning, Arjuna decided that he should not fight in the Battle of\\nKurukñetra. This was his own dec ision. Arjuna told the Lord that it was not\\npossible for him to enjoy the kingdom after killing his own kinsmen. This\\ndecision was based on the body becaus e he was thinking that the body was\\nhimself and that his bodily relations or expansions were his brot hers, nephews,\\nbrothers-in-law, grandfathers and so on . Therefore he wanted to satisfy his\\nbodily demands. Bhagavad-gétä  was spoken by the Lord just to change this\\nview, and at the end Arjuna decides to fight under the directions of the Lord\\nwhen he says, kariñye vacanaà tava  [Bg. 18.73 ]: “I shall act according to Your\\nword.”\\nIn this world men are not meant for quarreling like cats and dogs. MenCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.must be intelligent to realize the import ance of human life and refuse to act\\nlike ordinary animals. A human being sh ould realize the aim of his life, and\\nthis direction is given in all  Vedic literatures, and the essence is given in\\nBhagavad-gétä.  Vedic literature is meant for human beings, not for animals.\\nAnimals can kill other living animals, and there is no question of sin on their\\npart, but if a man kills an animal for the satisfact ion of his uncontrolled taste,\\nhe must be responsible for breaking the laws of nature. In the Bhagavad-gétä  it\\nis clearly explained that there are three kinds of activities according to the\\ndifferent modes of nature: the activities of goodness, of passion and of\\nignorance. Similarly, there are three kinds of eatables also: eatables in\\ngoodness, passion and ignorance. All of this is clearly described, and if we\\nproperly utilize the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä,  then our whole life will\\nbecome purified, and ultimately we will be able to reach the destination which\\nis beyond this material sky. [ Bg. 15.6 ]\\nThat destination is called the sanätana  sky, the eternal, spiritual sky. In this\\nmaterial world we find that everything is temporary. It comes into being, stays\\nfor some time, produces some by-product s, dwindles and then vanishes. That is\\nthe law of the ma terial world, whether we use as an example this body, or a\\npiece of fruit or anything. But beyond this temporary world there is another\\nworld of which we have information. Th at world consists of another nature,\\nwhich is sanätana,  eternal. Jéva is also desc ribed as sanätana,  eternal, and the\\nLord is also described as sanätana  in the Eleventh Chapter. We have an\\nintimate relationship with the Lord, and because we are all qualitatively\\none—the sanätana-dhäma,  or sky, the sanätana  Supreme Personality and the\\nsanätana  living entities—the whole purpose of Bhagavad-gétä  is to revive our\\nsanätana  occupation, or sanätana-dharma,  which is the eternal occupation of\\nthe living entity. We are temporarily engaged in different activities, but all of\\nthese activities can be  purified when we give up all these temporary activities\\nand take up the activities which are prescribed by the Supreme Lord. That is\\ncalled our pure life.\\nThe Supreme Lord and His transcendental abode are both sanätana,  as are\\nthe living entities, and the combined a ssociation of the Supreme Lord and the\\nliving entities in the sanätana  abode is the perfection of human life. The LordCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.i s  v e r y  k i n d  t o  t h e  l i v i n g  entities because they are His sons. Lord Kåñëa\\ndeclares in Bhagavad-gétä,  sarva-yoniñu.  .. ahaà béja-pradaù pitä : “I am the\\nfather of all.” Of course there are all ty pes of living entities according to their\\nvarious karmas,  but here the Lord claims that H e is the father of all of them.\\nTherefore the Lord descends to reclaim a ll of these fallen, conditioned souls, to\\ncall them back to the sanätana  eternal sky so that the sanätana  living entities\\nmay regain their eternal sanätana  positions in eternal associa tion with the\\nLord. The Lord comes Himself in diffe rent incarnations, or He sends His\\nconfidential servants as sons or His associates or äcäryas  to reclaim the\\nconditioned souls.\\nTherefore, sanätana-dharma  does not refer to any sectarian process of\\nreligion. It is the eternal function of the eternal living entities in relationship\\nwith the eternal Supreme Lord. Sanätana-dharma  refers, as stated previously,\\nto the eternal occupation  of the living entity. Çrépäda Rämänujäcärya has\\nexplained the word sanätana  as “that which has neither beginning nor end,” so\\nwhen we speak of sanätana-dharma,  w e  m u s t  t a k e  i t  f o r  g r a n t e d  o n  t h e\\nauthority of Çrépäda Rämänujäcärya that it has neither begin ning nor end.\\nThe English world religion  is a little different from sanätana-dharma.\\nReligion  conveys the idea of faith, and f aith may change. One may have faith\\nin a particular process, and he may ch ange this faith and adopt another, but\\nsanätana-dharma  refers to that activity which cannot be changed. For\\ninstance, liquidity cannot be taken from water, nor can heat be taken from\\nfire. Similarly, the eternal function of the eternal living entity cannot be\\ntaken from the living entity. Sanätana-dharma  is eternally integra l with the\\nliving entity. When we speak of sanätana-dharma,  therefore, we must take it\\nfor granted on the authority of Çrépäd a Rämänujäcärya that it has neither\\nbeginning nor end. That which has ne ither end nor beginning must not be\\nsectarian, for it canno t be limited by any boundaries. Those belonging to some\\nsectarian faith will wrongly consider that sanätana-dharma  is also sectarian,\\nbut if we go deeply into the matter an d consider it in the light of modern\\nscience, it is possible for us to see that sanä tana-dharma  is the business of all\\nthe people of the world—nay, of all the living entities of the universe.\\nNon- sanätana  religious faith may have some beginning in the annals ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.human history, but there is no beginning to the history of sanätana-dharma,\\nbecause it remains eternally with the living entities. Insofar as the living\\nentities are concerned, the autho ritative çästras  state that the living entity has\\nneither birth nor death. In the Gétä it is stated that the living entity is never\\nborn and he never dies. He is eternal and indestructible, and he continues to\\nlive after the destruction of his temporary ma terial body. In reference to the\\nconcept of sanätana-dharma,  we must try to understand the concept of religion\\nfrom the Sanskrit root meaning of the word. Dharma  refers to that which is\\nconstantly existing with a particular  object. We conclude that there i s heat\\nand light along with the fire; without he at and light, there is no meaning to\\nthe word fire. Similarly, we must discover  the essential part of the living being,\\nthat part which is his constant compan ion. That constant companion is his\\neternal qualit y, and that eternal quality is his eternal religion.\\nWhen Sanätana Gosvämé asked Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu about the\\nsvarüpa  of every living being, the Lord replied that the svarüpa,  or\\nconstitutional position, of the living being is the rendering of service to the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. If we analyze  this statement of Lord\\nCaitanya’s, we can easily see that ever y living being is constantly engaged in\\nrendering service to another living being. A living being serves other living\\nbeings in various capacities. By doing so, the living entity enjoys life. T he\\nlower animals serve human beings as servants serve their master. A serves B\\nmaster, B serves C master, and C serv es D master and so on. Under these\\ncircumstances, we can see that one fr iend serves another friend, the mother\\nserves the son, the wife serv es the husband, the husband serves the wife and so\\non. If we go on searching in this spirit, it will be seen that there is no exception\\nin the society of living beings to the activity of service. The politician presents\\nhis manifesto for the public to conv ince them of his capacity for service. The\\nvoters therefore give the politician thei r valuable votes, thinking that he will\\nrender valuable service to society. Th e shopkeeper serves the customer, and\\nthe artisan serves the capitalist. The capitalist serves  the family, and the family\\nserves the state in the terms of the eter nal capacity of the eternal living being.\\nIn this way we can see that no living being is exempt from rendering service to\\nother living beings, and therefore we can safely conclude that se rvice is theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.constant companion of the living being an d that the rendering of service is the\\neternal religion of the living being.\\nYet man professes to belong to a partic ular type of faith with reference to\\nparticular time and circumstance and thus claims to be a Hindu, Muslim,\\nChristian, Buddhist or an adherent of any other sect. Such designations are\\nnon— sanätana-dharma.  A Hindu may  change his faith to become a Muslim, or\\na Muslim may change his faith to become a Hindu, or a Christian may change\\nhis faith and so on. But in all circumstances the change of religious faith does\\nnot affect the eternal occupation of rendering service to o thers. The Hindu,\\nMuslim or Christian in all circumstances is servant of someone. Thus, to\\nprofess a particular type of faith is not to profess one’s sanätana-dharma.  The\\nrendering of service is sanätana-dharma.\\nFactually we are related to the Suprem e Lord in service. The Supreme Lord\\nis the supreme enjoyer, and we living entities are His servitors. We are created\\nfor His enjoyment, and if we participat e in that eternal enjoyment with the\\nSupreme Personality of Go dhead, we become happy. We cannot become happy\\notherwise. It is not possible to be happy  independently, just as no one part of\\nthe body can be happy without cooperating with the stomach. It is not possible\\nfor the living entity to be happy without renderin g transcendental loving\\nservice unto the Supreme Lord.\\nIn the Bhagavad-gétä,  worship of different demigods or rendering service to\\nthem is not approved. It is stated in the Seventh Chapter, twentieth verse :\\nkämais tais tair håta-jïänäù\\nprapadyante ’nya-devatäù\\ntaà taà niyamam ästhäya\\nprakåtyä niyatäù svayä\\n“Those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires surrender\\nunto demigods and follow the particul ar rules and regulations of worship\\naccording to their own natures.” Here it  is plainly said that those who are\\ndirected by lust worship the demigo ds and not the Supreme Lord Kåñëa. When\\nwe mention the name Kåñëa, we do  not refer to any sectarian name. Kåñëa\\nmeans the highest pleasure, and it is co nfirmed that the Supreme Lord is theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.reservoir or storehouse of all pleasure. We are all hankering after  pleasure.\\nÄnanda-mayo ’bhyäsät  (Vedänta-sütra  1.1.12 ). The living entities, like the Lord,\\nare full of consciousness, and they are after happiness. The Lord is perpetually\\nhappy, and if the living entities assoc iate with the Lord, cooperate with Him\\nand t ake part in His association, then they also become happy.\\nThe Lord descends to this mortal worl d to show His pastimes in Våndävana,\\nwhich are full of happiness. When Lord Çré Kåñëa was in Våndävana, His\\nactivities with His cowherd boyfriends, wi th His damsel friends, with the other\\ninhabitants of Våndävana and wi th the cows were all full of happiness. The\\ntotal population of Våndävana knew no thing but Kåñëa. But Lord Kåñëa even\\ndiscouraged His father Nanda Mahäräja from worshiping the demigod Indra,\\nbecause He wanted to establish th e fact that people need not wors hip any\\ndemigod. They need only worship th e Supreme Lord, because their ultimate\\ngoal is to return to His abode.\\nThe abode of Lord Çré Kåñëa is described in the Bhagavad-gétä,  Fifteenth\\nChapter, sixth verse:\\nna tad bhäsayate süryo\\nna çaçäìko na pävakaù\\nyad gatvä na nivartante\\ntad dhäma paramaà mama\\n“That supreme abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by\\nfire or electricity. Those who reach it never return to this material world.”\\nThis verse gives a description of that  e t e r n a l  s k y .  O f  c o u r s e  w e  h a v e  a\\nmaterial conception of the sky, and we think of it in relationship to the sun,\\nmoon, stars and so on, but in this verse the Lord states that in the eternal sky\\nthere is no need for the  sun nor for the moon nor electricity or fire of any kind\\nbecause the spiritual sky is already illuminated by the brahmajyoti,  the rays\\nemanating from the Supreme Lord. We are trying with difficulty to reach\\nother planets, but it is not difficult to unders tand the abode of the Supreme\\nLord. This abode is referred to as Goloka. In the Brahma-saàhitä  (5.37) it is\\nbeautifully described: goloka eva nivasaty akhilätma-bhütaù.  The Lord resides\\neternally in His abode Goloka, yet He  can be approached from this worl d, andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.to this end the Lord comes to manifest His real form, sac-cid-änanda-vigraha\\n[Bs. 5.1]. When He manifests this form, ther e is no need for our imagining what\\nHe looks like. To discourage such imaginative speculation, He descends and\\nexhibits Himself as He is, as Çyämasundara. Unfortunately, the less intelligent\\nderide Him because He comes as one of us and plays with us as a human being.\\nBut because of this we should not consid er the Lord one of us. It is by His\\nomnipotency that He presents Himself in His real form before us and displays\\nHis pastimes, which are replicas of those pastimes found in His abode.\\nIn the effulgent rays of the spiritual sky there are innumerable planets\\nfloating. The brahmajyoti  emanates from the supreme abode, Kåñëaloka, and\\nthe änanda-maya, cin-maya  planets, which are not material, float in those rays.\\nThe Lord says, na tad bhäsaya te süryo na çaçäìko na pävakaù/ yad gatvä na\\nnivartante tad dhäma paramaà mama [Bg. 15.6]. One who can approach that\\nspiritual sky is not required to descen d again to the material sky. In the\\nmaterial sky, even if we approa ch the highest planet (Brahmaloka ), what to\\nspeak of the moon, we will find the sa me conditions of life, namely birth,\\ndeath, disease and old age. No planet in the mat erial universe is free from\\nthese four principles of material existence.\\nThe living entities are traveling from one planet to another, but it is not\\nthat we can go to any planet we like merely by a mechanical arrangement. If\\nwe desire to go to other planets, there is a process for going there. This is also\\nmentioned: yänti deva -vratä devän pitèn yänti pitå-vratäù [Bg. 9.25]. No\\nmechanical arrangement is necessary if  we want interplanetary travel. The\\nGétä instructs: yänti deva-vratä devän.  The moon, the sun and higher planets\\nare called Svargaloka. There are three different stat uses of planets: higher,\\nmiddle and lower planetary systems. The earth belongs to the middle planetary\\nsystem. Bhagavad-gétä  informs us how to travel to  the higher planetary systems\\n(Devaloka) with a very simple formula: yänti deva-vratä devän.  One need on ly\\nworship the particular demigod of that particular planet and in that way go to\\nthe moon, the sun or any of the higher planetary systems.\\nYet Bhagavad-gétä  does not advise us to go to any of the planets in this\\nmaterial world, because even if we go to Brahmaloka, the highest planet,\\nthrough some sort of mechanical contrivance by maybe traveling for fortyCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.thousand years (and who would live th at long?), we will still find the material\\ninconveniences of birth, death, disease and old age. But one who wants to\\napproach the supreme planet, Kåñëaloka, or any of the other planets within\\nthe spiritual sky, will not meet with these material inconvenien ces. Amongst\\nall of the planets in the spiritual sky there is one supreme planet called Goloka\\nVåndävana, which is the original pl anet in the abode of the original\\nPersonality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa. All of this information is given in\\nBhagavad-gétä,  and we are given through its instruction information how to\\nleave the material world and begin a truly blissful life in the spiritual sky.\\nIn the Fifteenth Chapter  of the Bhagavad-gétä,  the real picture of the\\nmaterial world is given. It is said there:\\nürdhva-mülam adhaù-çäkham\\naçvatthaà prähur avyayam\\nchandäàsi yasya parëäni\\nyas taà veda sa veda-vit\\nHere the material world is described as a tree whose roots are upwards and\\nbranches are below. We have experience of a tree whose roots are upward: if\\none stands on the bank of a river or an y reservoir of water, he can see that the\\ntrees reflected in the w ater are upside down. The branches go downward and\\nthe roots upward. Similarly, this material world is a reflection of the spiritual\\nworld. The material world is but a shadow  of reality. In the shadow there is no\\nreality or substantiality, but from the sha dow we can understand that there are\\nsubstance and reality. In the desert th ere is no water, but the mirage suggests\\nthat there is such a thing as water. In the material world there is no water,\\nthere is no happiness, but the real water of actual happiness  is there in the\\nspiritual world.\\nThe Lord suggests that we attain the spiritual world in the following\\nmanner ( Bg. 15.5):\\nnirmäna-mohä jita-saìga-doñä\\nadhyätma-nityä vinivåtta-kämäù\\ndvandvair vimuktäù sukha-duùkha-saàjïair\\ngacchanty amüòhäù padam avyayaà tatCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.That padam avyayam,  or eternal kingdom, can be reached by one who is\\nnirmäna-moha.  What does this mean? We are after designations. Someone\\nwants to become “sir,” someone want s to become “lord,” someone wants to\\nbecome the president or a rich man or a king or something else. As long as we\\nare attached to these designations, we are attached to the body, because\\ndesignations belong to the body. But we are not these bodies, and realizing this\\nis the first stage in spiritual realization. We are associated with t he three modes\\nof material nature, but we must become  detached through devotional service\\nto the Lord. If we are not attached to devotional service to the Lord, then we\\ncannot become detached from the modes of material nature. Designations and\\nattachments are due to our lust and desire, ou r wanting to lord it over the\\nmaterial nature. As long as we do not gi ve up this propensity of lording it over\\nmaterial nature, there is no possibility of returning to the kingdom of the\\nSupreme, the sanätana-dhäma.  That e ternal kingdom, which is never\\ndestroyed, can be approached by one who is not bewildered by the attractions\\nof false material enjoyments, who is si tuated in the service of the Supreme\\nLord. One so situated can easily approach that supreme abode.\\nElsewhere in the Gétä (8.21) it is stated:\\navyakto ’kñara ity uktas\\ntam ähuù paramäà gatim\\nyaà präpya na nivartante\\ntad dhäma paramaà mama\\nAvyakta  means unmanifested. Not even all of the material world is\\nmanifested before us. Our senses are so  imperfect that we cannot even see all\\nof the stars within this material universe. In Vedic literature we can receive\\nmuch information about all the pl anets, and we can believe it or not believe it.\\nAll of the important planets are described in Vedic literatures, especially\\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam,  and the spiritual world, which is beyond this material sky,\\nis described as avyakta,  unmanifested. One should des ire and hanker after that\\nsupreme kingdom, for when one attains that kingdom, he does not have to\\nreturn to this material world.\\nNext, one may raise the question of how one goes about approaching thatCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.abode of the Supreme Lord. Informatio n of this is given in the Eighth\\nChapter. It is said there:\\nanta-käle ca mäm eva\\nsmaran muktvä kalevaram\\nyaù prayäti sa mad-bhävaà\\nyäti nästy atra saàçayaù\\n“Anyone who quits his body, at the end of life, remembering Me, attains\\nimmediately to My nature; and there is no doubt of this.” [ Bg. 8.5] One who\\nthinks of Kåñëa at the time of his deat h goes to Kåñëa. One must remember the\\nform of Kåñëa; if he quits his  body thinking of this form, he surely approaches\\nthe spiritual kingdom. Mad-bhävam  refers to the supreme nature of the\\nSupreme Being. The Supreme Being is sac-cid-änanda-vigraha  [Bs. 5.1]—that\\nis, His form is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. Our pres ent body is not\\nsac-cid-änanda.  It is asat,  not sat. It is not eternal; it is perishable. It is not cit,\\nfull of knowledge, but it is full of ig norance. We have no knowledge of the\\nspiritual kingdom, nor do we even ha ve perfect knowledge of this material\\nworld, where there are so many things  unknown to us. The body is also\\nniränanda;  instead of being full of bliss it is  full of misery. All of the miseries\\nwe experience in the material world arise from the body, but one who leaves\\nthis body thinking of Lord Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, at\\nonce attains a sac-cid-änanda  body.\\nThe process of quitting this body an d getting another body in the material\\nworld is also organized. A man dies after it has been decided what form of body\\nhe will have in the next life. Higher authorities, not the living entity himself,\\nmake this decision.  According to our activities in this life, we either rise or\\nsink. This life is a preparation for the ne xt life. If we can prepare, therefore, in\\nthis life to get promotion to the king dom of God, then surely, after quitting\\nthis material body, we will atta in a spiritual body just like the Lord’s.\\nAs explained before, there are differe nt kinds of transcendentalists—the\\nbrahma-vädé, paramätma-vädé  and the devotee—and, as mentioned, in the\\nbrahmajyoti  (spiritual sky) there are innumerable spiritual planets. The\\nnumber of these planets is far, far grea ter than all of the planets of thisCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.material world. This material world has been approximated as only one quarter\\nof the creation ( ekäàçena sthito jagat ). In this material segment there are\\nmillions and billions of universes with trillions of planets and s uns, stars and\\nmoons. But this whole material creation is only a fragment of the total\\ncreation. Most of the creation is in th e spiritual sky. One who desires to merge\\ninto the existence of the Supreme Brah man is at once transferred to the\\nbrahmajyoti  of t he Supreme Lord and thus attains the spiritual sky. The\\ndevotee, who wants to enjoy the assoc iation of the Lord, enters into the\\nVaikuëöha planets, which are innumerable, and the Supreme Lord by His\\nplenary expansions as Näräyaëa with four hands and with d ifferent names like\\nPradyumna, Aniruddha and Govinda associates with him there. Therefore at\\nthe end of life the transcendentalists think either of the brahmajyoti,  the\\nParamätmä or Supreme Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa. In all cases they\\nenter into the  spiritual sky, but only the devotee, or he who is in personal\\ntouch with the Supreme Lord, enters into the Vaikuëöha planets or the\\nGoloka Våndävana planet. The Lord furt her adds that of this “there is no\\ndoubt.” This must be believed firmly. We should no t reject that which does not\\ntally with our imagination; our attitude s h o u l d  b e  t h a t  o f  A r j u n a :  “ I  b e l i e v e\\neverything that You have said.” Therefor e when the Lord says that at the time\\nof death whoever thinks of Him as  Brahman or Paramätmä or as the\\nPerson ality of Godhead certainly enters in to the spiritual sky, there is no\\ndoubt about it. There is no question of disbelieving it.\\nThe Bhagavad-gétä  (8.6) also explains the general principle that makes it\\npossible to enter the spiritual kingdom simply by thinking of the Supreme at\\nthe time of death:\\nyaà yaà väpi smaran bhävaà\\ntyajaty ante kalevaram\\ntaà tam evaiti kaunteya\\nsadä tad-bhäva-bhävitaù\\n“Whatever state of being one remember s when he quits his present body, in\\nhis next life he will attain to that state without fail.” Now, first we must\\nunderstand that material nature is a display of one of the energies of theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Supreme Lord. In the Viñëu Pur äëa (6.7.61 ) the total energies of the Supreme\\nLord are delineated:\\nviñëu-çaktiù parä proktä\\nkñetra-jïäkhyä tathä parä\\navidyä-karma-saàjïänyä\\ntåtéyä çaktir iñyate\\n [Cc. Madhya 6.154 ]\\nThe Supreme Lord has diverse and innumerable energies which are beyond\\nour conception; however, great learned sages or liberated souls have studied\\nthese energies and have analyzed them in to three parts. All of the energies are\\nof viñëu-çakti,  that is to s ay they are different potencies of Lord Viñëu. The\\nfirst energy is parä,  transcendental. Living entities also belong to the superior\\nenergy, as has already been explained. Th e other energies, or material energies,\\nare in the mode of ignorance. At the time of death either we can remain in the\\ninferior energy of this material world, or we can transfer to the energy of the\\nspiritual world. So the Bhagavad-gétä  (8.6) says:\\nyaà yaà väpi smaran bhävaà\\ntyajaty ante kalevaram\\ntaà tam evaiti kaunteya\\nsadä tad-bhäva-bhävitaù\\n“Whatever state of being one remember s when he quits his present body, in\\nhis next life he will attain to that state without fail.”\\nIn life we are accustomed to thinking  either of the material or of the\\nspiritual energy. Now, how can we tran sfer our thoughts from the material\\nenergy to the spiritual energy? There are so many literatures which fill our\\nthoughts with the material energy— newspapers, magazines, novels, etc. Our\\nthinking, which is now absorbed in these literatures, must be transferred to the\\nVedic literatures. The great sages, th erefore, have written so many Vedic\\nliteratures, such as the Puräëas.  The Puräëas  are not imagina tive; they are\\nhistorical records. In the Caitanya-caritämåta  (Madhya  20.122 ) there is the\\nfollowing verse:Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.mäyä-mugdha jévera nähi svataù kåñëa-jïäna\\njévere kåpäya kailä kåñëa veda-puräëa\\nThe forgetful living entities or conditioned souls have forgotten their\\nrelationship with the Supreme Lord, an d they are engrossed in thinking of\\nmaterial activities. Just to transfer th eir thinking power to the spiritual sky,\\nKåñëa-dvaipäyana Vyäsa has gi ven a great number of Vedic literatures. First he\\ndivided the Vedas  into four, then he explained them in the Puräëas,  and for\\nless capable people he wrote the Mahäbhärata.  In the Mahäbhärata  there is\\ngiven the Bhagavad-gétä.  Then all Vedic literature is su mmarized in the\\nVedänta-sütra,  and for future guidance he ga ve a natural commentation on the\\nVedänta-sütra,  called Çrémad-Bhägavatam.  We must always engage our minds\\nin reading these Vedic literatures. Just  as materialists engage their minds in\\nreading new spapers, magazines and so many materialistic literatures, we must\\ntransfer our reading to these literatures which are given to us by Vyäsadeva; in\\nthat way it will be possible for us to re member the Supreme Lord at the time of\\ndeath. That is the only way s uggested by the Lord, and He guarantees the\\nresult: “There is no doubt.”\\ntasmät sarveñu käleñu\\nmäm anusmara yudhya ca\\nmayy arpita-mano-buddhir\\nmäm evaiñyasy asaàçayaù\\n“Therefore, Arjuna, you should always think of Me in the form of Kåñëa\\nand at the same time continue your prescribed duty of fighting. With your\\nactivities dedicated to Me and your mind and intelligence fixed on Me, you\\nwill attain Me without doubt.” ( Bg. 8.7)\\nH e  d o e s  n o t  a d v i s e  A r j u n a  s i m p l y  to remember Him and give up his\\noccupation. No, the Lord never suggests an ything impractical. In this material\\nworld, in order to maintain the bo dy one has to work. Human society is\\ndivided, according to work, into four div isions of social order— brähmaëa,\\nkñatriya, vaiçya  and çüdra.  The brähmaëa  class or intelligent class is working in\\none way, the kñatriya  or administrative class is working in another way, andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.the mercantile class and the labo rers are all tending to their s pecific duties. In\\nthe human society, whether one is a laborer, merchant, administrator or\\nfarmer, or even if one belongs to the highest class and is a literary man, a\\nscientist or a theologian, he has to wo rk in order to maintain his existence.\\nThe Lord t herefore tells Arjuna that he need not give up his occupation, but\\nwhile he is engaged in his occupa tion he should remember Kåñëa ( mäm\\nanusmara [Bg. 8.7]). If he doesn’t practice remembering Kåñëa while he is\\nstruggling for existence, then it will not be p ossible for him to remember Kåñëa\\nat the time of death. Lord Cait anya also advises this. He says, kértanéyaù sadä\\nhariù:  [Cc. adi 17.31 ] one should practice chanting the names of the Lord\\nalways. The names of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent. So Lord  Kåñëa’s\\ninstructions to Arjuna to “remember Me” and Lord Caitanya’s injunction to\\n“always chant the names of Lord Kåñëa” are the same instruction. There is no\\ndifference, because Kåñëa and Kåñëa’s name are nondifferent. In the absolute\\nstatus there is no difference between reference and referrent. Therefore we\\nhave to practice remembering the Lord  always, twenty-four hours a day, by\\nchanting His names and molding our life’s activities in such a way that we can\\nremember Him always.\\nHow is this possible? The äcäryas  give the following example. If a married\\nwoman is attached to another man, or if a man has an attachment for a woman\\nother than his wife, then the attachment is to be considered very strong. One\\nwith such an attachment is always thinking of the loved one. The wife who is\\nthinking of her lover is always thinking of meeting him, even while she is\\ncarrying out her household chores. In fa ct, she carries out her household work\\neven more carefully so her husband will not suspect her attachment. Similarly,\\nwe should always remember the supreme lover, Çré Kåñëa, and at the same time\\nperform our material duties very nicely. A strong sense of love is required here.\\nIf we have a strong sense of love for the Supreme Lord, then we can di scharge\\nour duty and at the same time remember Him. But we have to develop that\\nsense of love. Arjuna, for instance, was always thinking of Kåñëa; he was the\\nconstant companion of Kåñëa, and at the same time he was a warrior. Kåñëa\\ndid not advise him to gi ve up fighting and go to the forest to meditate. When\\nLord Kåñëa delineates the yoga system to Arjuna, Arjuna says that the practiceCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.of this system is not possible for him.\\narjuna uväca\\nyo ’yaà yogas tvayä proktaù\\nsämyena madhusüdana\\netasyähaà na paçyämi\\ncaïcalatvät sthitià sthiräm\\n“Arjuna said: O Madhusüdana, the system of yoga which You have\\nsummarized appears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is\\nrestless and unsteady.” ( Bg. 6.33)\\nBut the Lord says:\\nyoginäm api sarveñäà\\nmad-gatenäntarätmanä\\nçraddhävän bhajate yo mäà\\nsa me yuktatamo mataù\\n“Of all yogés,  the one with great faith who alwa ys abides in Me, thinks of Me\\nwithin himself, and renders transcendental loving service to Me is the most\\nintimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all. That is My\\nopinion.” ( Bg. 6.47) So one wh o thinks of the Supreme Lord always is the\\ngreatest yogé, the supermost jïäné,  and the greatest devotee at the same time.\\nThe Lord further tells Arjuna that as a kñatriya  he cannot give up his fighting,\\nbut if Arjuna fights remembering Kåñëa, then he will be able to remember\\nKåñëa at the time of death. But one mu s t  b e  c o m p l e t e l y  s u r r e n d e r e d  i n  t h e\\ntranscendental loving service of the Lord.\\nWe work not with our body, actually , but with our mind and intelligence.\\nSo if the intelligence and the mind are always engaged in the thought of the\\nSupreme Lord, then naturally the senses are also engaged in His service.\\nSuperficially, at least, the acti vities of the senses remain the same, but the\\nconsciousness is changed. The Bhagavad-gétä  teaches one how to absorb the\\nmind and intelligence in the thought of  the Lord. Such absorption will enable\\none to transfer himself to the kingdom of the Lord. If the  mind is engaged in\\nKåñëa’s service, then the senses are au tomatically engaged in His service. ThisCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.is the art, and this is also the secret of Bhagavad-gétä:  total absorption in the\\nthought of Çré Kåñëa.\\nModern man has struggled very hard to reach the moon, but he has not\\ntried very hard to elevate himself spiritually. If one has fifty years of life ahead\\no f  h i m ,  h e  s h o u l d  e n g a g e  t h a t  b r i e f  time in cultivating this practice of\\nremembering the Supreme Perso nality of Godhead.

This will lead to re membering the Supreme Lord and will\\nenable one, upon leaving the body, to att ain a spiritual body which is just fit\\nfor association with the Supreme Lord.\\nThe Lord further says:\\nabhyäsa-yoga-yuktena\\ncetasä nänya-gäminä\\nparamaà puruñaà divyaà\\nyäti pärthänucintayan\\n“He who meditates on Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind\\nconstantly engaged in remembering Me , undeviated from the path, he, O\\nArjuna, is sure to reach Me.” ( Bg. 8.8)\\nThis is not a very difficult process.  However, one must learn it from an\\nexperienced person. Tad vijïänärthaà sa gurum eväbhigac chet: [MU  1.2.12(3) ]\\none must approach a person who is alre ady in the practice. The mind is always\\nflying to this and that, but one  must practice concentrating the mind always\\non the form of the Supreme Lord, Çré Kå ñëa, or on the sound of His name. The\\nmind is naturally restless, going hither and thither, but it can rest in the soundCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.vibration of Kåñëa. One must thus meditate on param aà puruñam,  the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead in the spiritual kingdom, the spiritual sky,\\nand thus attain Him. The ways and the means for ultimate realization,\\nultimate attainment, are stated in the Bhagavad-gétä,  and the doors of this\\nknowledge are open  for everyone. No one is barred out. All classes of men can\\napproach Lord Kåñëa by thinking of Hi m, for hearing and thinking of Him is\\npossible for everyone.\\nThe Lord further says ( Bg. 9.32–33 ):\\nmäà hi pärtha vyapäçritya\\nye ’pi syuù päpa-yonayaù\\nstriyo vaiçyäs tathä çüdräs\\nte ’pi yänti paräà gatim\\nkià punar brähmaëäù puëyä\\nbhaktä räjarñayas tathä\\nanityam asukhaà lokam\\nimaà präpya bhajasva mäm\\nThus the Lord says that even a me rchant, a fallen woman or a laborer or\\neven human beings in the lowest status  of life can attain the Supreme. One\\ndoes not need highly developed intelli gence. The point is that anyone who\\naccepts the principle of bhakti-yog a and accepts the Supreme Lord as the\\nsummum bonum  of life, as the highest target, the ultimate goal, can approach\\nthe Lord in the spiritual sky. If one adopts the principles enunciated in\\nBhagavad-gétä,  he can make his life perfect and make a permanent so lution to\\nall the problems of life. This is the sum and substance of the entire\\nBhagavad-gétä.\\nIn conclusion, Bhagavad-gétä  is a transcendental literature which one\\nshould read very carefully.

All Rights Reserved.Bhagavad-gétä  is the widely read theistic science summarized in the\\nGétä-mähätmya  (Glorification of the Gétä ). There it says that one should read\\nBhagavad-gétä  very scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a devotee of\\nÇré Kåñëa and try to understan d it without personally motivated\\ninterpretations. The example of cl ear understanding is there in the\\nBhagavad-gétä  itself, in the way the teaching is understood by Arjuna, who\\nheard the Gétä directly from the Lord. If someone is fortunate enough to\\nunders tand Bhagavad-gétä  in that line of disciplic succession, without\\nmotivated interpretation, then he surpasses all studies of Vedic wisdom, and all\\nscriptures of the world. One will find in the Bhagavad-gétä  all that is contained\\nin other scriptures, but the  reader will also find things which are not to be\\nfound elsewhere. That is the specific standard of the Gétä.  It is the perfect\\ntheistic science because it is directly spoken by the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa.\\nThe topics discussed by Dhåtaräñöra and Saïjaya, as described in the\\nMahäbhärata,  form the basic principle for this great philosophy. It is\\nunderstood that this philosophy evol ved on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra,\\nwhich is a sacred place of pilgrimage from  the immemorial time of the Vedic\\nage. It was spoken by the Lord when He  was present personally on this planet\\nfor the guidance of mankind.\\nThe word dharma-kñetra  (a place where religious rituals are performed) is\\nsignificant because, on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, the Supreme Personality\\nof Godhead was present on the side of Arjuna. Dhåtaräñöra, the father of the\\nKurus, was highly doubtful  about the possibility of his sons’ ultimate victory. In\\nhis doubt, he inquired from his secretar y Saïjaya, “What did they do?” He was\\nconfident that both his sons and the sons of his younger brother Päëòu were\\nassembled in that Field of Kurukñetra for a d etermined engagement of the war.\\nStill, his inquiry is significant. He did not want a compromise between the\\ncousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the\\nbattlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kurukñet ra, which\\nis mentioned elsewhere in the Vedas  as a place of worship—even for the\\ndenizens of heaven—Dhåtaräñöra became  very fearful about the influence of\\nthe holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well that this wouldCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.influence Arjuna and t he sons of Päëòu favorably, because by nature they\\nwere all virtuous. Saïjaya was a student of Vyäsa, and therefore, by the mercy\\nof Vyäsa, Saïjaya was able to envision the Battlefield of Kurukñetra even while\\nhe was in the room of Dhåtaräñöra. And so, Dhå taräñöra asked him about the\\nsituation on the battlefield.\\nBoth the Päëòavas and the sons of Dh åtaräñöra belong to the same family,\\nbut Dhåtaräñöra’s mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his\\nsons as Kurus, and he separated the sons of Päëòu from the family heritage.\\nOne can thus understand the sp ecific position of Dhåtaräñöra in his\\nrelationship with his nephews, the sons  o f  P ä ë ò u .  A s  i n  t h e  p a d d y  f i e l d  t h e\\nunnecessary plants are taken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of\\nthese topics that in the religi ous field of Kurukñetra, where t he father of\\nreligion, Çré Kåñëa, was present, the unwanted plants like Dhåtaräñöra’s son\\nDuryodhana and others would be wiped out and the thoroughly religious\\npersons, headed by Yudhiñöhira, would be established by the Lord. This is the\\nsignificance of th e words dharma-kñetre  and kuru-kñetre,  apart from their\\nhistorical and Vedic importance.\\nTEXT  2\\nSaÅYa ovac\\nd*îa Tau Paa<@vaNaqk&- VYaU!& duYaaeRDaNaSTada )\\nAacaYaRMauPaSa®MYa raJaa vcNaMab]vqTa( )) 2 ))\\nsaïjaya uväca\\ndåñövä tu päëòavänékaà\\nvyüòhaà duryodhanas tadä\\näcäryam upasaìgamya\\nräjä vacanam abravét\\nSYNONYMS\\nsaïjayaù uväca —Saïjaya said; dåñövä —after seeing; tu—but;Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Un fortunately, he was also bereft of\\nspiritual vision. He knew very well that his sons were equally blind in the\\nmatter of religion, and he was sure that they could never reach an\\nunderstanding with the Päëòavas, who were all pious since birth. Still he was\\ndoubtful about the influence of the pl ace of pilgrimage, and Saïjaya could\\nunderstand his motive in asking about the situation on the battlefield. Saïjaya\\nwanted, therefore, to encourage the despondent king and thus assu red him\\nthat his sons were not going to make any sort of compromise under the\\ninfluence of the holy place. Saïjaya th erefore informed the king that his son,\\nDuryodhana, after seeing the military fo rce of the Päëòavas, at once went to\\nthe commander in chief , Droëäcärya, to inform him of the real position.\\nAlthough Duryodhana is mentioned as the king, he still had to go to the\\ncommander on account of the seriousne ss of the situation.

Droëäcärya had some\\npolitical quarrel with King Drupada, th e father of Draupadé, who was Arjuna’s\\nwife. As a result of this quarrel, Drupada  performed a great sacrifice, by which\\nhe received the benediction of havi ng a son who would be able to kill\\nDroëäcärya. Droëäcärya knew this perfectly well, and yet as a liberal\\nbrähmaëa  he did not hesitate to impart a ll his military secrets when the son of\\nDrupada, Dhåñöadyumna, was entrusted to him for military education. Now, on\\nthe Battlefield of Kurukñetra, Dhåñöady umna took the side of the Päëòavas,\\nand it was he who arranged for their military phalanx, after having learned the\\nart from Droëäcärya. D uryodhana pointed out this mistake of Droëäcärya’s so\\nthat he might be alert and uncompromisi ng in the fighting.

Here on the Battlefield\\nof Kurukñetra the Lord directly controls  the transcendental senses of Arjuna,\\nand thus His particular name of Håñékeça. The Lord has dif ferent names\\naccording to His different activities. For example, His name is Madhusüdana\\nbecause He killed the demon of the name Madhu; His name is Govinda\\nbecause He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name is Väsudeva\\nbecause He appeared as  the son of Vasudeva; His name is Devaké-nandana\\nbecause He accepted Devaké as His mother; His name is Yaçodä-nandana\\nbecause He awarded His childhood pastimes to Yaçodä at Våndävana; His\\nname is Pärtha-särathi because He worked as charioteer of His friend  Arjuna.\\nSimilarly, His name is Håñékeça because He gave direction to Arjuna on the\\nBattlefield of Kurukñetra.\\nArjuna is referred to as Dhanaïjaya in this verse because he helped his\\nelder brother in fetching wealth when it was required  by the king to make\\nexpenditures for different sacrifices. Similarly, Bhéma is known as Våkodara\\nbecause he could eat as voracious ly as he could perform herculean tasks, such\\nas killing the demon Hiòimba. So the particular types of conchshell blown by\\nthe different personalities on the side of the Päëòavas, beginning with the\\nLord’s, were all very encouraging to the fighting soldiers . On the other side\\nthere were no such credits, nor the presence of Lord Kåñëa, the supreme\\ndirector, nor that of the goddess of fort une.

The emblem of\\nHanumän on the flag of Arjuna is an other sign of victory because Hanumän\\ncooperated with Lord Räma in the battle between Räma and Rävaëa, and Lord\\nRäma emerged victorious.

Lord Kåñëa is Räma Himself, and wherever\\nLord Räma is, His eternal servitor Ha numän and His eternal consort Sétä, the\\ngoddess of fortune, are present.

In all circumstances, He is the Supreme Pers onality of Godhead,\\nHåñékeça, the Lord of the total senses. The relationship between the Lord and\\nHis servitor is very sweet and transcen dental. The servitor is always ready to\\nrender service to the Lord, and, simi larly, the Lord is always seeking an\\noppor tunity to render some service to the devotee. He takes greater pleasure in\\nHis pure devotee’s assuming the advant ageous position of ordering Him than\\nHe does in being the giver of orders. Si nce He is master, everyone is under His\\norders, and no one is abov e Him to order Him. But when He finds that a pure\\ndevotee is ordering Him, He obtains tr anscendental pleasure, although He is\\nthe infallible master of all circumstances.\\nAs a pure devotee of the Lord, Arjuna  had no desire to fight with his\\ncousins and brothers, but he was forced to come onto the battlefield by the\\nobstinacy of Duryodhana, who was never agreeable to any peaceful\\nnegotiation. Therefore, he was very anxious t o see who the leading persons\\npresent on the battlefield were.

Guòäkä  means sleep, and\\none who conquers sleep is called guòäkeça.  Sleep also means ignorance. So\\nArjuna conquered both sleep and ignorance because of his friendship with\\nKåñëa. As a great devotee of Kåñëa, he could not forget Kåñëa even for a\\nmoment, because that is the nature of a de votee. Either in waking or in sleep, a\\ndevotee of the Lord can never be free from thinking of Kåñëa’s name, form,\\nqualities and pastimes. Thus a de votee of Kåñëa can conquer bot h sleep and\\nignorance simply by thinking of Kå ñëa constantly. This is called Kåñëa\\nconsciousness, or samädhi.  As Håñékeça, or the director of the senses and mind\\nof every living entity, Kåñëa could unde rstand Arjuna’s purpose in placing the\\nchariot in the midst of the armies.

A s such, Arjuna, just after seeing his kinsmen,\\nfriends and relatives on the battlefield, was at once overwhelmed by\\ncompassion for them who had so decided to fight amongst themselves. As far as\\nhis soldiers were concerned, he was sympathetic from the begin ning, but he\\nfelt compassion even for the soldiers of  the opposite party, foreseeing their\\nimminent death. And while he was so th inking, the limbs of his body began to\\nquiver, and his mouth became dry. He was more or less astonished to see their\\nfighting s pirit. Practically the whole community, all blood relatives of Arjuna,\\nhad come to fight with him. This ov erwhelmed a kind devotee like Arjuna.\\nAlthough it is not mentioned here, sti ll one can easily imagine that not only\\nwere Arjuna’s bodily limbs quiveri ng and his mouth drying up, but he was also\\ncrying out of compassion.

The\\nwords nimittäni viparétäni  are significant. When a man sees only frustration in\\nhis expectations, he thinks, “Why am I he re?” Everyone is interested in himself\\nand his own welfare. No one is interested in the Supreme Self. Arjuna is\\nshowing ig norance of his real self-interest by Kåñëa’s will. One’s real\\nself-interest lies in Viñëu, or Kåñëa.

O\\nmaintainer of all living entities, I am not prepared to fight wit h them even in\\nexchange for the three worlds, let alone this earth. What pleasure will we derive\\nfrom killing the sons of Dhåtaräñöra?\\nPURPORT\\nArjuna has addressed Lord Kåñëa as Govinda because Kåñëa is the object of\\nall pleasures for cows and the senses. By using this significant word, Arjuna\\nindicates that Kåñëa should understand what will satisfy Arjuna’s senses. But\\nGovinda is not meant for s atisfying our senses. If we try to satisfy the senses of\\nGovinda, however, then automatically our own senses are satisfied. Materially,\\neveryone wants to satisfy his senses, an d he wants God to be the order supplier\\nfor such satisfaction. The Lord will sat isfy the senses of the living entities as\\nmuch as they deserve, but not to the ex tent that they may covet. But when one\\ntakes the opposite way—namely, when one tries to satisfy the senses of\\nGovinda without desiring to satisfy one’s own senses—then by the grace of\\nGovinda all desires of the living entity are satisfied. Arjuna’s deep affection\\nfor community and family members is exhi bited here partly due to his natural\\ncompassion for them. He is therefore no t prepared to fight. Everyone wants to\\nshow his opu lence to friends and relatives, but Arjuna fears that all his\\nrelatives and friends will be killed on the battlefield and he will be unable to\\nshare his opulence after victory. This is  a typical calculation of material life.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.The transcendental life, howeve r, is different. Since a devotee wants to satisfy\\nthe desires of the Lord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for\\nthe service of the Lord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a\\nfarthing. Arjuna did not want to kill his rela tives, and if there were any need\\nto kill them, he desired that Kåñëa kill them personally. At this point he did\\nnot know that Kåñëa had already killed them before their coming into the\\nbattlefield and that he was only to become an instrument for Kåñëa. Th is fact\\nis disclosed in following chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did\\nnot like to retaliate against his miscre ant cousins and brothers, but it was the\\nL o r d ’ s  p l a n  t h a t  t h e y  s h o u l d  a l l  b e  k i lled. The devotee of the Lord does not\\nretaliate  against the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief\\ndone to the devotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His\\nown account, but He excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees.\\nTherefore the Lord was determined to kill t he miscreants, although Arjuna\\nwanted to excuse them.\\nTEXT  36\\nPaaPaMaevaé[YaedSMaaNhTvETaaNaaTaTaaiYaNa\" )\\nTaSMaaàahaR vYa& hNTau& DaaTaRraí\\\\aNSabaNDavaNa( )\\nSvJaNa& ih k-Qa& hTva Saui%Na\" SYaaMa MaaDav )) 36 ))\\npäpam eväçrayed asmän\\nhatvaitän ätatäyinaù\\ntasmän närhä vayaà hantuà\\ndhärtaräñörän sa-bändhavän\\nsva-janaà hi kathaà hatvä\\nsukhinaù syäma mädhava\\nSYNONYMS\\npäpam —vices; eva—certainly; äçrayet —must come upon; asmän —us;\\nhatvä —by killing; etän—all these; ätatäyinaù —aggressors; tasmät —therefore;Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Therefore it is not proper for\\nus to kill the sons of Dhåtaräñöra and our friends. What should we gain, O\\nKåñëa, husband of the goddess of fortune, and how could we be happy by killing\\nour own kinsmen?\\nPURPORT\\nAccording to Vedic injunctions there are six kinds of aggressors: (1) a\\npoison giver, (2) one who sets fire to the house, (3) one who attacks with\\ndeadly weapons, (4) one who plunders riches, (5) one who occupies another’s\\nland, and (6) one who kidnaps a w ife. Such aggressors are at once to be killed,\\nand no sin is incurred by killing such a ggressors. Such killing of aggressors is\\nquite befitting any ordinary man, but Arjuna was not an ordinary person. He\\nwas saintly by character, and therefore he wanted to  deal with them in\\nsaintliness. This kind of saintliness, however, is not for a kñatriya.  Although a\\nresponsible man in the administration of a state is required to be saintly, he\\nshould not be cowardly. For example, Lord Räma was so saintly that people\\neven now are anxious to live in the kingdom of Lord Räma ( räma-räjya ), but\\nLord Räma never showed any cowardice. Rävaëa was an aggressor against\\nRäma because Rävaëa kidnapped Räma’s wife, Sétä, but Lord Räma gave him\\nsufficient lessons, unparalleled in the h i s t o r y  o f  t h e  w o r l d .  I n  A r j u n a ’ s  c a s e ,\\nhowever, one should consider the special  type of aggressors, namely his own\\ngrandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc. Because of them,\\nArjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary a gainst\\nordinary aggressors. Besides that, saintly persons are advised to forgive. Such\\ninjunctions for saintly persons are more important than any politicalCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.emergency. Arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for\\npolitical reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and\\nsaintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing profitable simply\\nfor the matter of temporary bodily happiness. After all, kingdoms and\\npleasures derived therefrom are not permanent, so wh y should he risk his life\\nand eternal salvation by killing his own kinsmen? Arjuna’s addressing of Kåñëa\\nas “Mädhava,” or the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in\\nthis connection. He wanted to point out to Kåñëa that, as husband of the\\ngoddess of fortune, He should not indu ce Arjuna to take up a matter which\\nwould ultimately bring about misfortune. Kåñëa, however, never brings\\nmisfortune to anyone, to say nothing of His devotees.\\nTEXTS  37–38\\nYaÛPYaeTae Na PaXYaiNTa l/ae>aaePahTaceTaSa\" )\\nku-l/+aYak*-Ta& daez& iMa}ad]aehe c PaaTak-Ma( )) 37 ))\\nk-Qa& Na jeYaMaSMaai>a\" PaaPaadSMaaiàviTaRTauMa( )\\nku-l/+aYak*-Ta& daez& Pa[PaXYaiÙJaRNaadRNa )) 38 ))\\nyady apy ete na paçyanti\\nlobhopahata-cetasaù\\nkula-kñaya-kåtaà doñaà\\nmitra-drohe ca pätakam\\nkathaà na jïeyam asmäbhiù\\npäpäd asmän nivartitum\\nkula-kñaya-kåtaà doñaà\\nprapaçyadbhir janärdana\\nSYNONYMS\\nyadi—if; api—even; ete—they; na—do not; paçyanti —see; lobha —by greed;\\nupahata —overpowered; cetasaù —their hearts; kula-kñaya —in killing the\\nfamily; kåtam —done; doñam —fault; mitra-drohe —in quarreling with friends;Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The varëäçrama  religion’s principles\\nwere so designed that the good popula tion would prevail in society for the\\ngeneral spiritual progress of stat e and community. Such population depends on\\nthe chastity and faithfulness of its womanhood. As children are very prone to\\nbe misled, women are similarly very prone to degradation. Therefore, both\\nchildren and women require protection by the elder members o f the family. By\\nbeing engaged in various religious practices, women will not be misled into\\nadultery. According to Cäëakya Paëòita, women are generally not very\\nintelligent and therefore not trustworthy.  So the different family traditions of\\nreligious act ivities should always engage th em, and thus their chastity and\\ndevotion will give birth to a good popula tion eligible for participating in the\\nvarëäçrama  system. On the failure of such varëäçrama-dharma,  naturally the\\nwomen become free to act and mix with men, and thus adultery is indulged in\\nat the risk of unwanted population.

Lord Kåñëa killed the demon\\nMadhu, and now Arjuna wanted Kåñëa  to kill the demon of misunderstanding\\nthat had overtaken him in the discharge of his duty. No one knows where\\ncompassion should be applied. Compassion for the dress of a drowning man is\\nsenseless.

One who does not know\\nthis and laments for the outward dress is called a çüdra,  or one who laments\\nunnecessarily. Arjuna was a kñatriya,  and this conduct was not expected from\\nhim. Lord Kåñëa, howe ver, can dissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man,\\nand for this purpose the Bhagavad-gétä  was sung by Him. This chapter instructs\\nus in self-realization by an analytical study of the material body and the spirit\\nsoul, as explained by the supreme autho rity, Lord Çré Kåñëa.

They are no t at all befitting a man who knows the\\nvalue of life. They lead not to higher planets but to infamy.\\nPURPORT\\nKåñëa and the Supreme Personality of  Godhead are identical. Therefore\\nLord Kåñëa is referred to as Bhagavän throughout the Gétä.  Bhagavän is the\\nultimate in the Absolute Truth. Absolute  Truth is realized in three phases of\\nunderstanding, namely Brahman, or  the impersonal all-pervasive spirit;Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Paramätmä, or the localized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all\\nliving entities; and Bhagavän, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord\\nKåñëa. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.2.11 ) this conception of the Absol ute\\nTruth is explained thus:\\nvadanti tat tattva-vidas\\ntattvaà yaj jïänam advayam\\nbrahmeti paramätmeti\\nbhagavän iti çabdyate\\n“The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the\\nknower of the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical. Such phases of\\nthe Absolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Paramätmä, and Bhagavän.”\\nThese three divine aspects can be ex plained by the example of the sun,\\nwhich also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun’s surface\\nand the sun planet itself. One who studie s the sunshine only is the preliminary\\nstudent. One who understan ds the sun’s surface is further advanced. And one\\nwho can enter into the sun planet is th e highest. Ordinary students who are\\nsatisfied by simply understanding the sunshine—its universal pervasiveness\\nand the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature—may  be compared to those\\nwho can realize only the Brahman featur e of the Absolute Truth. The student\\nwho has advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to\\nknowledge of the Paramätmä feature of the Absolute Truth. And the student\\nwho can e nter into the heart of the sun pl anet is compared to those who\\nrealize the personal features of the Su preme Absolute Truth. Therefore, the\\nbhaktas,  or the transcendentalists who have  realized the Bhagavän feature of\\nthe Absolute Truth, are the topmost tran scendentalists, although all students\\nwho are engaged in the study of the Ab solute Truth are engaged in the same\\nsubject matter. The sunshine, the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun\\nplanet cannot be separated from one another, and yet the students o f the three\\ndifferent phases are not in the same category.\\nThe Sanskrit word bhagavän  is explained by the great authority Paräçara\\nMuni, the father of Vyäsadeva. The Supreme Personality who possesses all\\nriches, all strength, all fame, all beau ty, all knowledge and all renunciation isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.called Bhagavän. There are ma ny persons who are very rich, very powerful,\\nvery beautiful, very famous, very learned, and very much detached, but no one\\ncan claim that he possesses all riches, a ll strength, etc., entirely. Only Kåñëa\\ncan claim this because He is the Supreme Personality  of Godhead. No living\\nentity, including Brahmä, Lord Çiva, or Näräyaëa, can possess opulences as\\nfully as Kåñëa. Therefore it is concluded in the Brahma-saàhitä  by Lord\\nBrahmä himself that Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No\\none is equal to or above Him. He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagavän, known as\\nGovinda, and He is the supreme cause of all causes:\\néçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù\\nsac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù\\nanädir ädir govindaù\\nsarva-käraëa-käraëam\\n“There are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagavän, but\\nKåñëa is the supreme because none can excel Him. He is the Supreme Person,\\nand His body is eternal, full of knowle dge and bliss. He is the primeval Lord\\nGovinda and the cause of all ca uses.” ( Brahma-saàhitä  5.1)\\nIn the Bhägavatam  also there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead, but Kåñëa is described as the original Personality of\\nGodhead, from whom many, many incarn ations and Personalities of Godhead\\nexpand:\\nete cäàça-kaläù puàsaù\\nkåñëas tu bhagavän svayam\\nindräri-vyäkulaà lokaà\\nmåòayanti yuge yuge\\n“All the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either\\nplenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme\\nGodhead, but Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.” ( Bhäg.\\n1.3.28 )\\nTherefore, Kåñëa is the original Su preme Personality of Godhead, the\\nAbsolute Truth, the source of bo th the Supersoul and the impersonalCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Brahman.\\nIn the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna’s\\nlamentation for his kinsmen is certain ly unbecoming, and therefore. Kåñëa\\nexpressed His surprise with the word kutaù,  “wherefrom.” Such impurities were\\nnever expected from a person belonging t o the civilized class of men known as\\nÄryans. The word Äryan  is applicable to persons who know the value of life\\nand have a civilization based on spirit ual realization. Persons who are led by\\nthe material conception of life do not know that the aim of life  is realization of\\nthe Absolute Truth, Viñëu, or Bhagav än, and they are captivated by the\\nexternal features of the material worl d, and therefore they do not know what\\nliberation is. Persons who have no kn owledge of liberation from material\\nbondage are call ed non-Äryans. Although Arjuna was a kñatriya,  he was\\ndeviating from his prescribed duties by declining to fight. This act of\\ncowardice is described as befitting th e non-Äryans. Such deviation from duty\\ndoes not help one in the progress of spiritual life, nor does it even give one the\\nopportunity to become famous in this wo rld. Lord Kåñëa did not approve of the\\nso-called compassion of Arjuna for his kinsmen.\\nTEXT  3\\n©E-BYa& Maa SMa GaMa\" PaaQaR NaETatvYYauPaPaÛTae )\\n+aud]& ôdYadaEbRLYa& TYa¤-aeitaï ParNTaPa )) 3 ))\\nklaibyaà mä sma gamaù pärtha\\nnaitat tvayy upapadyate\\nkñudraà hådaya-daurbalyaà\\ntyaktvottiñöha parantapa\\nSYNONYMS\\nklaibyam —impotence; mä sma —do not; gamaù —take to; pärtha —O son of\\nPåthä; na—never; etat—this; tvayi —unto you; upadyate —is befitting;\\nkñudram —petty; hådaya —of the heart; daurbalyam —weakness;Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Arjuna\\nwas the most intimate friend of Kåñëa, and Kåñëa was dire ctly guiding him on\\nthe chariot; but in spite of all these cr edits, if Arjuna abandoned the battle he\\nwould be committing an infamous act. Therefore Kåñëa said that such an\\nattitude in Arjuna did not fit his personality. Arjuna might argue that he\\nwould gi ve up the battle on the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the\\nmost respectable Bhéñma and his relatives, but Kåñëa considered that sort of\\nmagnanimity mere weakness of heart.  Such false magnanimity was not\\napproved by any authority. Therefore, such m agnanimity or so-called\\nnonviolence should be given up by persons like Arjuna under the direct\\nguidance of Kåñëa.\\nTEXT  4\\nAJauRNa ovac\\nk-Qa& >aqZMaMah& Sa&:Yae d]ae<a& c MaDauSaUdNa )\\nwzui>a\" Pa[iTaYaaeTSYaaiMa PaUJaahaRvirSaUdNa )) 4 ))\\narjuna uväcaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

In every step  there is perplexity, and therefore it\\nbehooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper\\nguidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic literatures advise us to\\napproach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life,\\nwhich happen without our desire. They are like a forest fire that somehow\\nblazes without being set by anyone. Similarly , the world situation is such’ that\\nperplexities of life automatically appe ar, without our wanting such confusion.\\nNo one wants fire, and yet it takes plac e, and we become perplexed. The Vedic\\nwisdom therefore advises that in  order to solve the perplexitie s of life and to\\nunderstand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master\\nwho is in the disciplic succession. A person  with a bona fide spiritual master is\\nsupposed to know everything. One should  not, therefore, remain in material\\nperpl exities but should approach a spiritua l master. This is the purport of this\\nverse.\\nWho is the man in material perplexiti es? It is he who does not understand\\nthe problems of life. In the Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad  (3.8.10 ) the perplexed\\nman is described as follows: yo vä etad akñaraà gärgy aviditväsmäû lokät praiti sa\\nkåpaëaù.  “He is a miser ly man who does not solve the problems of life as a\\nhuman and who thus quits this world like the cats and dogs, without\\nunderstanding the science of self-realization.” This human form of life is a\\nmost valuable asset for the living entity who can utilize i t for solving the\\nproblems of life; therefore, one who does not utilize this opportunity properlyCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.is a miser. On the other hand, there is the brähmaëa,  or he who is intelligent\\nenough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of life. Ya etad akñaraà\\ngärgi viditväsmäû lokät praiti sa brähmaëaù.\\nThe kåpaëas,  or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly\\naffectionate for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life.\\nOne is often attached to family life, namely to wife, children and other\\nmembers, on the basis of “skin d isease.” The kåpaëa  thinks that he is able to\\nprotect his family members from death; or the kåpaëa  thinks that his family or\\nsociety can save him from the verge of death. Such family attachment can be\\nfound even in the lower animal s, who take care of child ren also. Being\\nintelligent, Arjuna could understand that  his affection for family members and\\nhis wish to protect them from death were the causes of his perplexities.\\nAlthough he could understand that his du ty to fight was awaiting him, still, on\\naccount of miserly weakness, he could not di scharge the duties. He is therefore\\nasking Lord Kåñëa, the supreme spiritua l master, to make a definite solution.\\nHe offers himself to Kåñëa as a disciple. He wants to stop friendly talks. Talks\\nbetween the master and th e disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk\\nvery seriously before the recognized spiritual master. Kåñëa is therefore the\\noriginal spiritual master of the science of Bhagavad-gétä,  and Arjuna is the first\\ndisciple for understanding the Gétä.  How A rjuna understands the\\nBhagavad-gétä  is stated in the Gétä itself. And yet foolish mundane scholars\\nexplain that one need not submit to Kåñëa as a person, but to “the unborn\\nwithin Kåñëa.” There is no difference between Kåñëa’s within and without.\\nAnd one w ho has no sense of this understand ing is the greatest fool in trying\\nto understand Bhagavad-gétä.\\nTEXT  8\\nNa ih Pa[PaXYaaiMa MaMaaPaNauÛa‚\\n ÛC^aek-MauC^aez<aiMaiNd]Yaa<aaMa( )\\nAvaPYa >aUMaavSaPaÒMa*Ö&Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

He could understand th at his so-called knowledge was useless in\\ndriving away his problems, which were drying up his whole existence; and it\\nwas impossible for him to solve such perple xities without the help of a spiritual\\nmaster like Lord Kåñëa. Academic knowledge, scholarship,  high position, etc.,\\nare all useless in solving the problems of life; help can be given only by a\\nspiritual master like Kåñëa. Therefore, the conclusion is that a spiritual master\\nwho is one hundred percent Kåñëa consci ous is the bona fide spiritual maste r,\\nfor he can solve the problems of life. Lord Caitanya said that one who is masterCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

It is also\\nsaid in Vedic literature:\\nñaö-karma-nipuëo vipro\\nmantra-tantra-viçäradaù\\navaiñëavo gurur na syäd\\nvaiñëavaù çva-paco guruù\\n“A scholarly brähmaëa,  expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge, is unfit to\\nbecome a spiritual master without being a Vaiñëava, or expert in the science of\\nKåñëa consciousness. But a person born in a family of a lower caste can become\\na spiritual master if he is a Vaiñëava, or Kåñëa conscious.” ( Padma Puräëa )\\nThe problems of material existence—birth, old age, disease and\\ndeath—cannot be counteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic\\ndevelopment. In many parts of the wo rld there are states which are replete\\nwith all facilities of life, which are full of wea lth and economically developed,\\nyet the problems of material existence are still present. They are seeking peace\\nin different ways, but they can achiev e real happiness only if they consult\\nKåñëa, or the Bhagavad-gétä  and Çrémad-Bhägavatam —which constitute the\\nscience of Kåñëa—through the bona fide  representative of Kåñëa, the man in\\nKåñëa consciousness.\\nIf economic development and material  comforts could drive away one’s\\nlamentations for family, social, nation al or international inebrieties, then\\nArjuna would not have said that ev en an unrivaled kingdom on earth or\\nsupremacy like that of the demigods in t he heavenly planets would be unableCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.to drive away his lamentations. He sought, therefore, refuge in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness, and that is the right path for peace and harmony. Economic\\ndevelopment or supremacy over the worl d can be finished at any moment by\\nthe cataclysms of material nature. Even  elevation into a higher planetary\\nsituation, as men are now seeking on th e moon planet, can also be finished at\\none stroke. The Bhagavad-gétä  confirms this: kñéëe puëye martya-lokaà viçanti.\\n“When the results of pious a ctivities are finished, one falls down again from\\nthe peak of happiness to the lowest stat u s  o f  l i f e . ”  M a n y  p o l i t i c i a n s  o f  t h e\\nworld have fallen down in that way. Such downfalls only constitute more\\ncauses for lamentation.\\nTherefore, if we want to curb lament ation for good, then we have to take\\nshelter of Kåñëa, as Arjuna is seeking to  do. So Arjuna asked Kåñëa to solve his\\nproblem definitely, and that is the way of Kåñëa consciousness.\\nTEXT  9\\nSaÅYa ovac\\nWvMau¤-a ôzqke-Xa& Gau@ake-Xa\" ParNTaPa\" )\\nNa YaaeTSYa wiTa GaaeivNdMau¤-a TaUZ<aq& b>aUv h )) 9 ))\\nsaïjaya uväca\\nevam uktvä håñékeçaà\\nguòäkeçaù parantapaù\\nna yotsya iti govindam\\nuktvä tüñëéà babhüva ha\\nSYNONYMS\\nsaïjayaù uväca —Saïjaya said; evam —thus; uktvä —speaking; håñékeçam —unto\\nKåñëa, the master of the senses; guòäkeçaù —Arjuna, the master of curbing\\nignorance; parantapaù —the chastiser of the enemies; na yotsye —I shall not\\nfight; iti—thus; govindam —unto Kåñëa, the giver of pleasure to the senses;\\nuktvä —saying; tüñëém —silent; babhüva —became; ha—certainly.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The Lord said, “You are talking like a\\nlearned man, but you do not know th at one who is learned—one who knows\\nwhat is body and what is soul—does n ot lament for any stage of the body,\\nneither in the living nor in the dead  condition.” As explained in later\\nchapters, it will be clear that knowledg e means to know matter and spirit and\\nthe controller of both. Arjuna argued that religious principles shoul d be given\\nmore importance than politics or sociology, but he did not know that\\nknowledge of matter, soul and the Supreme is even more important than\\nreligious formularies. And because he wa s lacking in that knowledge, he should\\nnot have posed himself as a  very learned man. As he did not happen to be a\\nvery learned man, he was consequently lamenting for something which was\\nunworthy of lamentation.

The Lord says clearly that He Himself, Arjuna and all the kings\\nwho are assembled on the battlefi eld are eternally individual beings and that\\nthe Lord is eternally the maintainer of the individual living entities both in\\ntheir conditioned and in their liberate d situations. The Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead is the supreme individual person, and Arjuna , the Lord’s eternal\\nassociate, and all the kings assembled there are individual eternal persons. It is\\nnot that they did not exist as individuals in the past, and it is not that they will\\nnot remain eternal persons. Their individuality existed in the past , and their\\nindividuality will continue in the fu ture without interruption. Therefore,\\nthere is no cause for lamentation for anyone.\\nThe Mäyävädé theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by\\nthe covering of mäyä,  or illusion, will merge into the impersonal Brahman and\\nlose its individual existence is not supported herein by Lord Kåñëa, the\\nsupreme authority. Nor is the  theory that we only think of individuality in the\\nconditioned state supported herein. Kåñë a clearly says herein that in the\\nfuture also the individuality of the Lord  and others, as it is confirmed in the\\nUpaniñads,  will continue eternally. This statement of Kåñëa’s is authoritative\\nbecause Kåñëa cannot be subject to illusion. If individuality were not a fact,\\nthen Kåñëa would not have stressed it  so much—even for the future. The\\nMäyävädé may argue that the individuality spoken of by Kåñëa is not spiritual,\\nbut material. Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material,\\nthen how can one distinguish Kåñëa’ s individuality? Kåñëa affirms His\\nindividuality in the past and confirms His individuality in the future also. He\\nhas confirmed His individua lity in many ways, and impersonal Brahman has\\nbeen declared to be subordinate to Him. Kåñëa has maintained spiritual\\nindividuality all along; if He is accept ed as an ordinary conditioned soul in\\nindividual consciousness, then His Bhagavad-gétä  has no value  as authoritative\\nscripture. A common man with all the fo ur defects of human frailty is unable\\nto teach that which is worth hearing. The Gétä is above such literature. NoCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.mundane book compares with the Bhagavad-gétä.  When one accepts Kåñëa as\\nan ordinary m an, the Gétä loses all importance. The Mäyävädé argues that the\\nplurality mentioned in this verse is conven tional and that it refers to the body.\\nBut previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already condemned.\\nAfter condemning the bodily concepti on of the living entities, how was it\\npossible for Kåñëa to place a conventi onal proposition on the body again?\\nTherefore, individuality is maintained on spiritual grounds and is thus\\nconfirmed by great äcäryas  like Çré Rämänuja and others. It is clearly\\nmentioned in many places in the Gétä that this spiritual individuality is\\nunderstood by those who are devotees of the Lord. Those who are envious of\\nKåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona fide access to the\\ngreat literature. The nondevotee ’s approach to the teachings of the Gétä is\\nsomething like that of a bee licking on  a bottle of honey. One cannot have a\\ntaste of honey unless one opens the bottl e. Similarly, the mysticism of the\\nBhagavad-gétä  can be understood only by devotees, and no on e else can taste it,\\nas it is stated in the Fourth Chapter  of the book. Nor can the Gétä be touched\\nby persons who envy the very existenc e of the Lord. Therefore, the Mäyävädé\\nexplanation of the Gétä is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth.\\nLord Caitanya has forbidden us to read  commentations made by the Mäyävädés\\nand warns that one who takes to such  an understanding of the Mäyävädé\\nphilosophy loses all power to understand the real mystery of the Gétä.  If\\nindividuality refers to the empirical u niverse, then there is no need of teaching\\nby the Lord. The plurality of the individu al soul and of the Lord is an eternal\\nfact, and it is confirmed by the Vedas  as above mentioned.\\nTEXT  13\\ndeihNaae_iSMaNYaQaa dehe k-aEMaar& YaaEvNa& Jara )\\nTaQaa dehaNTarPa[aiáDasrSTa}a Na MauùiTa )) 13 ))\\ndehino ’smin yathä dehe\\nkaumäraà yauvanaà jarä\\ntathä dehäntara-präptirCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Yet the same spirit soul is there and does not\\nundergo any change. This individual  soul finally changes the body at death\\nand transmigrates to another body; and sinc e it is sure to have another body in\\nthe next birth—either material or spiritual—there was no cause for\\nlamentation by Arjuna on account of  death, neither for Bhéñma nor for  Droëa,\\nfor whom he was so much concerned. Rather, he should rejoice for their\\nchanging bodies from old to new ones, thereby rejuvenating their energy. Such\\nchanges of body account for varieties of enjoyment or suffering, according to\\none’s work in life. S o Bhéñma and Droëa, being noble souls, were surely going\\nto have spiritual bodies in the next life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for\\nsuperior enjoyment of material existence. So, in either case, there was no cause\\nof lamentation.\\nAny man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual\\nsoul, the Supersoul, and nature—both material and spiritual—is called a dhéra,\\nor a most sober man. Such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.The Mäyävädé theory of oneness of th e spirit soul cannot be entertained, on\\nthe ground that the spirit soul canno t be cut into pieces as a fragmental\\nportion. Such cutting into different in dividual souls would make the Supreme\\ncleavable or changeable, agai nst the principle of the Supreme Soul’s being\\nunchangeable. As confirmed in the Gétä,  the fragmental portions of the\\nSupreme exist eternally ( sanätana ) and are called kñara;  that is, they have a\\ntendency to fall down into material nature. These fragmental portions are\\neternally so, and even after liberati on the individual soul remains the\\nsame—fragmental. But once liberated, he  lives an eternal life in bliss and\\nknowledge with the Personality of Godhead. The theory of reflection can be\\napplied to the Supers oul, who is present in each and every individual body and\\nis known as the Paramätmä. He is different from the individual living entity.\\nWhen the sky is reflected in water, the reflections represent both the sun and\\nthe moon and the stars also. The stars ca n be compared to the living entities\\nand the sun or the moon to the Supr eme Lord. The individual fragmental\\nspirit soul is represented by Arjuna, and the Supreme Soul is the Personality of\\nGodhead Çré Kåñëa. They are not on the same level, as it will be ap parent in\\nthe beginning of the Fourth Chapter. If  Arjuna is on the same level with\\nKåñëa, and Kåñëa is not superior to Arjuna, then their relationship of\\ninstructor and instructed becomes meanin gless. If both of them are deluded by\\nthe illusory energy ( mäyä), then there is no need of one being the instructor\\nand the other the instructed. Such instru ction would be useless because, in the\\nclutches of mäyä,  no one can be an authorit ative instructor. Under the\\ncircumstances, it is admitted that Lord Kåñëa is th e Supreme Lord, superior in\\nposition to the living entity, Arjuna, who is a forgetful soul deluded by mäyä.\\nTEXT  14\\nMaa}aaSPaXaaRSTau k-aENTaeYa  XaqTaaeZ<aSau%du\"%da\" )\\nAaGaMaaPaaiYaNaae_iNaTYaaSTaa&iSTaiTa+aSv >aarTa )) 14 ))\\nmäträ-sparçäs tu kaunteya\\nçétoñëa-sukha-duùkha-däùCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

By nature, the body is ever ch anging, and the soul is eternal. This\\nconclusion is established by all classes of seers of the truth, both impersonalist\\nand personalist. In the Viñëu Puräëa  (2.12.38 ) it is stated that Viñëu and His\\nabodes all have self-illuminated spiritual existence ( jyotéàñi viñëur bhuvanäni\\nviñëuù ). The words existent  and nonexistent  refer only to spirit and ma tter.\\nThat is the version of all seers of truth.\\nThis is the beginning of the instructio n by the Lord to the living entities\\nwho are bewildered by the influence of ignorance. Removal of ignorance\\ninvolves the reestablishment of the eternal relationship between the worshiper\\nand the worshipable and the co nsequent understanding of the difference\\nbetween the part-and-parcel living en tities and the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead. One can understand the nature  of the Supreme by thorough study\\nof oneself, the difference between oneself and the Supreme being und erstood\\nas the relationship between th e part and the whole. In the Vedänta-sütras,  as\\nwell as in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam,  the Supreme has been accepted as the\\norigin of all emanations. Such emanat ions are experienced by superior and\\ninferior natural sequence s. The living entities belong to the superior nature, as\\nit will be revealed in the Seventh Ch apter. Although there is no difference\\nbetween the energy and the energetic,  the energetic is accepted as the\\nSupreme, and energy or nature is accepted as the sub ordinate.

This spreading of consciousness is limited within one’s own\\nbody. The pains and pleasures of one body are unknown to another. Therefore,\\neach and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul, and the symptom\\nof the soul’s presence is perceived as i ndividual consciousness. This soul isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.described as one ten-thousandth part of  the upper portion of the hair point in\\nsize. The Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (5.9) confirms this:\\nbälägra-çata-bhägasya\\nçatadhä kalpitasya ca\\nbhägo jévaù vijïeyaù\\nsa cänantyäya kalpate\\n“When the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and\\nagain each of such parts is further di vided into one hundred parts, each such\\npart is the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul.” Similarly the same\\nversion is stated:\\nkeçägra-çata-bhägasya\\nçatäàçaù sädåçätmakaù\\njévaù sükñma-svarüpo ’yaà\\nsaìkhyätéto hi cit-kaëaù\\n [Cc. Madya 19.140 ]\\n“There are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as\\none ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair.”\\nTherefore, the individual particle of sp irit soul is a spiritual atom smaller\\nthan the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable. This very small\\nspiritual spark is the basic principle of  the material body, and the influence of\\nsuch a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the active\\nprinciple of some medicine spreads throughout the body. This current of the\\nspirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the proof of the\\npresence of the soul. Any layman can  understand that the material body minus\\nconsciousness is a dead body, and this consciousness cannot be revived in the\\nbody by any means of material administ ration. Therefore, consciousness is not\\ndue to any amount of material combination, but to the spiri t soul. In the\\nMuëòaka Upaniñad  (3.1.9) the measurement of the atom ic spirit soul is further\\nexplained:\\neño ’ëur ätmä cetasä veditavyo\\nyasmin präëaù païcadhä saàviveçaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Only\\nthe insane man can think of this atomic soul as all-pervading viñëu-tattva.\\nThe influence of the atomic soul can be  spread all over a particular body.\\nAccording to the Muëòaka Upaniñad,  this atomic soul is situated in the heart\\nof every living entity, and because th e measurement of the atomic soul is\\nbeyond the power of appreciati on of the material scientists, some of them\\nassert foolishly that there is no soul. The individual atomic soul is definitely\\nthere in the heart along with the Supersou l, and thus all the energies of bodily\\nmovement are emanating from this part of the body.  The corpuscles which\\ncarry the oxygen from the lungs gather  energy from the soul. When the soul\\npasses away from this position, the activity of the blood, generating fusion,\\nceases. Medical science accepts the impo rtance of the red corpuscles, but it\\ncann ot ascertain that the source of the energy is the soul. Medical science,\\nhowever, does admit that the heart is the seat of all energies of the body.\\nSuch atomic particles of the spirit  whole are compared to the sunshine\\nmolecules. In the sunshine there are innumerable radiant molecules. Similarly,\\nthe fragmental parts of the Supreme Lord are atomic sparks of the rays of the\\nSupreme Lord, called by the name prabhä,  or superior energy.

He is\\nunborn, eternal, ever-existing and primeval. He is not slain when the body is\\nslain.\\nPURPORT\\nQualitatively, the small atomic fragment al part of the Supreme Spirit is one\\nwith the Supreme. He undergoes no ch anges like the body. Sometimes the soul\\nis called the steady, or küöa-stha.  The body is subject to six kinds of\\ntransformations. It takes its b irth from the womb of the mother’s body, remains\\nfor some time, grows, produces some e ffects, gradually dwindles, and at last\\nvanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes.\\nThe soul is not born, but, because he takes on a mate rial body, the body takes\\nits birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die.\\nAnything which has birth also has deat h. And because the soul has no birth,\\nhe therefore has no past, present or fu ture. He is eternal, ever-existing, and\\nprimeval—that is, there is no trace in hi story of his coming into being. Under\\nthe impression of the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul. The\\nsoul does not at any time become old, as the body does. The so-called old man,\\ntherefore, feels h imself to be in the same spirit  as in his childhood or youth.\\nThe changes of the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate\\nlike a tree, nor anything material. Th e soul has no by-product either. The\\nby-products of the body, namely children,  are also different individual souls;\\nand, owing to the body, they appear as children of a particular man. The body\\ndevelops because of the soul’s presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor\\nchange. Therefore, the soul is free from the six changes of the body.\\nIn the Kaöha Upaniñad  (1.2.18 ) we also find a similar passage, which reads:\\nna jäyate mriyate vä vipaçcin\\nnäyaà kutaçcin na babhüva kaçcitCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Therefore,\\nconsciousness is the symptom of the soul . Even if one does not find the soul\\nwithin the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand the presence of\\nthe soul simply by th e presence of consciousness. Sometimes we do not find the\\nsun in the sky owing to clouds, or for some other reason, but the light of the\\nsun is always there, and we are convince d that it is therefore daytime. As soon\\nas there is a little light in the sky e arly in the morning, we can understand that\\nthe sun is in the sky. Similarly, since there is some consciousness in all\\nbodies—whether man or animal—we can un derstand the presence of the soul.\\nThis consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the c onsciousness of\\nthe Supreme because the supreme cons ciousness is all-knowledge—past,\\npresent and future. The consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be\\nforgetful. When he is forgetful of hi s real nature, he obtains education and\\nenlightenment from  the superior lessons of Kåñë a. But Kåñëa is not like the\\nforgetful soul. If so, Kåñëa’s teachings of Bhagavad-gétä  would be useless.\\nThere are two kinds of souls—name ly the minute particle soul ( aëu-ätmä )\\nand the Supersoul ( vibhu-ätmä ). This is also confirmed in the Kaöha Upaniñad\\n(1.2.20 ) in this way:\\naëor aëéyän mahato mahéyän\\nätmäsya jantor nihito guhäyäm\\ntam akratuù paçyati véta-çoko\\ndhätuù prasädän mahimänam ätmanaù\\n“Both the Supersoul [Paramätmä] and the atomic soul [ jévätmä ] are situated\\non the same tree of the body within th e same heart of the living being, and\\nonly one who has become free from all material desires as well as lamentations\\ncan, by the grace of the S upreme, understand the glories of the soul.” Kåñëa isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Although  the justice of the peace awards capital\\npunishment to a person condemned for murder, the justice of the peaceCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

In Manu-saàhitä,  the lawbook for mankind, it is  supported\\nthat a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will\\nnot have to suffer for the great sin he  has committed. Therefore, the king’s\\npunishment of hanging a murderer is actually beneficial. Similarly, when\\nKåñëa orders figh ting, it must be concluded that violence is for supreme\\njustice, and thus Arjuna should follow the instruction, knowing well that such\\nviolence, committed in the act of fighting  for Kåñëa, is not violence at all\\nbecause, at any rate, the man, or rather the  soul, cannot be killed; so for the\\nadministration of justice, so-called violence is permitted. A surgical operation\\nis not meant to kill the patient, but to cure him. Therefore the fighting to be\\nexecuted by Arjuna at the inst ruction of Kåñëa is with full  knowledge, so there\\nis no possibility of sinful reaction.\\nTEXT  22\\nvaSaa&iSa Jaq<aaRiNa YaQaa ivhaYa\\n NavaiNa Ga*õaiTa Narae_Parai<a )\\nTaQaa Xarqrai<a ivhaYa Jaq<aaR‚\\n NYaNYaaiNa Sa&YaaiTa NavaiNa dehq )) 22 ))\\nväsäàsi jérëäni yathä vihäya\\nnaväni gåhëäti naro ’paräëi\\ntathä çaréräëi vihäya jérëäny\\nanyäni saàyäti naväni dehé\\nSYNONYMS\\nväsäàsi —garments; jérëäni —old and worn out; yathä —just as; vihäya —giving\\nup; naväni —new garments; gåhëäti —does accept; naraù —a man;\\naparäëi —others; tathä —in the same way; çaréräëi —bodies; vihäya —giving up;\\njirëäni —old and useless; anyäni —different; saàyäti —verily accepts;\\nnaväni —new sets; dehé—the embodied.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Even the\\nmodern scientists who do not believe in  the existence of the soul, but at the\\nsame time cannot explain the source of energy from the heart, have to accept\\ncontinuous changes of body  which appear from childhood to boyhood and\\nfrom boyhood to youth and again from youth to old age. From old age, the\\nchange is transferred to another body. This has already been explained in a\\nprevious verse ( 2.13).\\nTransference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible\\nby the grace of the Supersoul. The Supe rsoul fulfills the desire of the atomic\\nsoul as one friend fulfills the desire of another. The Vedas,  like the Muëòaka\\nUpaniñad,  as well as t he Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad,  compare the soul and the\\nSupersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. One of the birds (the\\nindividual atomic soul) is eating th e fruit of the tree, and the other bird\\n(Kåñëa) is simply watching His friend. Of these t wo birds—although they are\\nthe same in quality—one is captivated by  the fruits of the material tree, while\\nthe other is simply witnessing the ac tivities of His friend. Kåñëa is the\\nwitnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eati ng bird. Although they are friends, one\\nis still the master and the other is the servant. Forgetfulness of this\\nrelationship by the atomic soul is the cause of one’s changing his position from\\none tree to another, or from one body to another. The jéva soul is struggling\\nvery hard on the tree  of the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept\\nthe other bird as the supreme spiritual master—as Arjuna agreed to do by\\nvoluntary surrender unto Kåñëa fo r instruction—the subordinate bird\\nimmediately becomes free from all lamentations. Both the Muëòaka Upaniñad\\n(3.1.2) and Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (4.7) confirm this:Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

And thus, hearing from Kåñëa, he\\ncan understand the supreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation.\\nArjuna is advised herewith by the Lord  not to lament for the bodily change\\nof his old grandfather and his teacher. He should rather be happy to kill their\\nbodies in the righteous fight so that they may be cleansed at once of all\\nreactions from various bodi ly activities. One who lays down his life on the\\nsacrificial altar, or in the proper battl efield, is at once cleansed of bodily\\nreactions and promoted to a higher stat us of life.

In the\\nVaräha Puräëa,  the living entities are described as separated parts and parcels\\nof the Supreme. They are eternally so, according to the Bhagava d-gétä  also.

When Lord\\nKåñëa spoke the Bhagavad-gétä,  it appears that such philosophers existed, and\\nthey were known as the lokäyatikas  and vaibhäñikas.  Such philosophers\\nmaintain that life symptoms take pl ace at a certain mature condition of\\nmaterial combination. The modern material scientist and materialist\\nphilosophers also think similarly. According to them, the body is a\\ncombination of physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms\\ndevelop by interaction of the physical  and chemical elements. The science of\\nanthropology is based on this philosophy. Currently, many pseudo\\nreligions—now becoming fashionable in Am erica—are also adhering to this\\nphilosophy, as well as to the nihilistic nondevotional Buddhist sects.\\nEven if Arjuna did not believe in the existence of the soul—as in the\\nvaibhäñika  philosophy—there would still have  been no cause for lamentation.\\nNo one laments the loss of a certain bu lk of chemicals and stops discharging\\nhis prescribed duty. On the other  hand, in modern science and scientific\\nwarfare, so many tons of chemicals ar e wasted for achieving victory over the\\nenemy. According to the vaibhäñika  philosophy, the so-called soul or ätmä\\nvanishes along with the deterioration of the body. So, in any cas e, whetherCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Arjuna accepted the Vedic conclusion that  there is an atomic soul or he did\\nnot believe in the existence of the soul, he had no reason to lament. According\\nto this theory, since there are so many living entities generating out of matter\\nevery mo ment, and so many of them are being vanquished every moment,\\nthere is no need to grieve for such inci dents. If there were no rebirth for the\\nsoul, Arjuna had no reason to be afraid  of being affected by sinful reactions\\ndue to his killing his grandfather an d teacher. But at the same time, Kåñëa\\nsarcastically addressed Arjuna as mahä-bähu,  mighty-armed, because He, at\\nleast, did not accept the theory of the vaibhäñikas,  which leaves aside the Vedic\\nwisdom. As a kñatriya,  Arjuna belonged to the Vedic culture, and it behooved\\nhim to continue to follow its principles.\\nTEXT  27\\nJaaTaSYa ih Da]uvae Ma*TYauDa]uRv& JaNMa Ma*TaSYa c )\\nTaSMaadPairhaYaeR_QaeR Na Tv& XaaeicTauMahRiSa )) 27 ))\\njätasya hi dhruvo måtyur\\ndhruvaà janma måtasya ca\\ntasmäd aparihärye ’rthe\\nna tvaà çocitum arhasi\\nSYNONYMS\\njätasya —of one who has taken his birth; hi—certainly; dhruvaù —a fact;\\nmåtyuù —death; dhruvam —it is also a fact; janma —birth; måtasya —of the\\ndead; ca—also; tasmät —therefore; aparihärye —of that which is unavoidable;\\narthe —in the matter; na—do not; tvam —you; çocitum —to lament;\\narhasi —deserve.\\nTRANSLATION\\nOne who has taken his birth is sure to die, and after death one is sure to\\ntake birth again.

Nonbelievers in the existence\\nof the soul are calle d atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet even if, for\\nargument’s sake, we accept this atheis tic theory, there is still no cause for\\nlamentation. Apart from the separate  existence of the soul, the material\\nelements remain unmanifested before creation. F rom this subtle state of\\nnonmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated;\\nfrom air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth\\nbecomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take\\nplace. Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth. When it\\nis dismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as\\natoms in the ultimate stage. The law of conservation of energy remains, but in\\ncourse of time things a re manifested and unmanifested—that is the difference.\\nThen what cause is there for lamentatio n either in the stage of manifestation\\nor in unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage,\\nthings are not lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain\\nunmanifested, and only in the middle ar e they manifested, and this does not\\nmake any real material difference.\\nAnd if we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the Bhagavad-gétä  that\\nthese material bodies are perishable in due course of time ( antavanta ime\\ndehäù ) but that the soul is eternal ( nityasyoktäù çarériëaù ) ,  t h e n  w e  m u s t\\nremember always that the body is like a dress; therefore why lament the\\nchanging of a dress? The material body has no factual existence in relation toCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.the eternal soul. It is something like  a dream. In a dream we may think of\\nflying in the sky, or sitting on  a chariot as a king, but when we wake up we can\\nsee that we are neither in the sky nor seated on the chariot. The Vedic wisdom\\nencourages self-realization on the basi s of the nonexistence of the material\\nbody. Therefore, in either case, whethe r one believes in the existence of the\\nsoul or one does not believe in the existe nce of the soul, there is no cause for\\nlamentation for loss of the body.\\nTEXT  29\\nAaêYaRvTPaXYaiTa k-iêdeNa‚\\n MaaêYaRvÜdiTa TaQaEv caNYa\" )\\nAaêYaRvÀENaMaNYa\" é*<aaeiTa\\n é[uTvaPYaeNa& ved Na cEv k-iêTa( )) 29 ))\\näçcarya-vat paçyati kaçcid enam\\näçcarya-vad vadati tathaiva cänyaù\\näçcarya-vac cainam anyaù çåëoti\\nçrutväpy enaà veda na caiva kaçcit\\nSYNONYMS\\näçcarya-vat —as amazing; paçyati —sees; kaçcit —someone; enam —this soul;\\näçcarya-vat —as amazing; vadati —speaks of; tathä —thus; eva—certainly;\\nca—also; anyaù —another; äçcarya-vat —similarly amazing; ca—also;\\nenam —this soul; anyaù —another; çåëoti —hears of; çrutv ä—having heard;\\napi—even; enam —this soul; veda—knows; na—never; ca—and;\\neva—certainly; kaçcit —someone.\\nTRANSLATION\\nSome look on the soul as amazing, some describe him as amazing, and some\\nhear of him as amazing, while others, even after hearing about him, cannotCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Kñat  means hurt. One who\\ngives protection from harm is called kñatriya  (träyate —to give protection). The\\nkñatriyas  are trained for  killing in the forest. A kñatriya  would go into the\\nforest and challenge a tiger face to face  and fight with the tiger with his sword.\\nWhen the tiger was killed, it would be  offered the royal order of cremation.\\nThis system has been followed even up to th e present day by the kñatriya  kings\\nof Jaipur state. The kñatriyas  are specially trained for challenging and killing\\nbecause religious violence is sometimes a necessary factor. Therefore, kñatriyas\\nare never meant for accepting directly the order of sannyä sa, or renunciation.\\nNonviolence in politics may be a dipl omacy, but it is never a factor or\\nprinciple. In the religious law books it is stated:\\nähaveñu mitho ’nyonyaà\\njighäàsanto mahé-kñitaù\\nyuddhamänäù paraà çaktyä\\nsvargaà yänty aparäì-mukhäù\\nyajïeñu paçavo brahman\\nhanyante satataà dvijaiù\\nsaàskåtäù kila mantraiç ca\\nte ’pi svargam aväpnuvan\\n“In the battlefield, a king or kñatriya,  while fighting another king envious of\\nhim, is eligible for achieving heavenly planets after death, as the brähmaëas\\nalso attain the heavenly planets by sacr ificing animals in the sacrificial fire.”Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The animal\\nsacrificed gets a human life immediat ely without undergoing the gradual\\nevolutionary process from on e form to another, and the kñatriyas  killed on the\\nbattlefield also attain the heavenly planets as do the brähmaëas  who attain\\nthem by offering sacrifice.\\nThere are two kinds of sva-dharmas,  specific duties. As long as one is not\\nliberated, one has to perform the duties of his particular body in accordance\\nwith religious principles in order to ac hieve liberation. When one is liberated,\\none’s sva-dharma —speci fic duty—becomes spiritual and is not in the material\\nbodily concept. In the bodily conception of life there are specific duties for the\\nbrähmaëas  and kñatriyas  respectively, and such duties are unavoidable.\\nSva-dharma  is ordained by the Lord, and this wil l be clarified in the Fourth\\nChapter. On the bodily plane sva-dharma  is called varëäçrama-dharma,  or\\nman’s steppingstone for spiritual unde rstanding. Human civilization begins\\nfrom the stage of varëäçrama-dharma,  or specific duties in terms of the specific\\nmodes of nature of the body obtained.

All Rights Reserved.describes the real nature of the soul. And yoga involves controlling the senses.\\nArjuna’s proposal not to fi ght was based on sense gratification. Forgetting his\\nprime duty, he wanted to cease fighting , because he thought that by not killing\\nhis relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom\\nafter conquering his cousins and brothers, the s ons of Dhåtaräñöra. In both\\nways, the basic principles were for sense gratification. Happiness derived from\\nconquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on\\nthe basis of personal sense gratificatio n, even at a sacrifice of wisdom a nd duty.\\nKåñëa, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his\\ngrandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all\\nindividual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they\\nwere individ uals in the past, they are individu als in the present, and they will\\ncontinue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual\\nsouls eternally. We simply change our bodily dress in different manners, but\\nactually we keep our individual ity even after liberation from the bondage of\\nmaterial dress. An analytical study of  the soul and the body has been very\\ngraphically explained by Lord Kåñëa. And this descriptive knowledge of the\\nsoul and the body from different angles of vision has been d escribed here as\\nSäìkhya, in terms of the Nirukti  dictionary. This Säìkhya has nothing to do\\nwith Säìkhya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long before the imposter\\nKapila’s Säìkhya, the Säìkhya philosophy was expounded in the\\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam  by the true  Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord Kåñëa,\\nwho explained it to His mother, Devahüti . It is clearly explained by Him that\\nthe puruña,  or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over\\nthe prakåti.  This is accepted in the Vedas  and in the Gétä.  The description in\\nthe Vedas  indicates that the Lord glanced over the prakåti,  or nature, and\\nimpregnated it with atomic individual souls. All these individuals are working\\nin the material world for sense gratification, and under the spell of materia l\\nenergy they are thinking of being enjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the\\nlast point of liberation when the living  entity wants to become one with the\\nLord. This is the last snare of mäyä,  or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is\\nonly after many, ma ny births of such sense gratif icatory activities that a great\\nsoul surrenders unto Väsudeva, Lord Kåñë a, thereby fulfilling the search afterCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.the ultimate truth.\\nArjuna has already accepted Kåñëa as his spiritual master by surrendering\\nhimself unto Him: çiñyas te ’haà çädhi mäà tväà prapannam . Consequently,\\nKåñëa will now tell him about the working process in buddhi-yoga,  or\\nkarma-yoga,  or in other words, the pract ice of devotional service only for the\\nsense gratification of the Lord. This buddhi-yoga  is clearly explained in\\nChapter Ten , verse ten, as being direct communion with the Lord, who is\\nsitting as Paramätmä in everyone’s heart. But such communion does not t ake\\nplace without devotional service. One who is therefore situated in devotional\\nor transcendental loving service to the Lord, or, in other words, in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness, attains to this stage of buddhi-yoga  by the special grace of the\\nLord. The Lord says , therefore, that only to those who are always engaged in\\ndevotional service out of transcende ntal love does He award the pure\\nknowledge of devotion in love. In th at way the devotee can reach Him easily\\nin the ever-blissful kingdom of God.\\nThus the buddhi-yoga  mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of\\nthe Lord, and the word Säìkhya mentione d herein has nothing to do with the\\natheistic säìkhya-yoga  enunciated by the imposter Kapila. One should not,\\ntherefore, misunderstand that the  säìkhya-yoga  mentioned herein has any\\nconnection with the atheistic Säìkhya.  Nor did that philosophy have any\\ninfluence during that time; nor would Lo rd Kåñëa care to mention such godless\\nphilosophical speculations. Real Säìkhya philosophy is described by  Lord\\nKapila in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam,  but even that Säìkhya has nothing to do\\nwith the current topics. Here, Säìkhya means analytical description of the\\nbody and the soul. Lord Kåñëa made an analytical description of the soul just\\nto bring Arjuna to the p oint of buddhi-yoga,  or bhakti-yoga.  Therefore, Lord\\nKåñëa’s Säìkhya and Lord Kapila’s Säìkhya, as described in the Bhägavatam,\\nare one and the same. They are all bhakti-yoga.  Lord Kåñëa Said, therefore,\\nthat only the less intelligent class of men make a d istinction between\\nsäìkhya-yoga  and bhakti-yoga  (säìkhya-yogau påthag bäläù pravadanti na\\npaëòitäù ).\\nOf course, atheistic säìkhya-yoga  has nothing to do with bhakti-yoga,  yet\\nthe unintelligent claim that the atheistic säìkhya-yoga  is referred to in theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

One who\\nworks for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however difficult such work may\\nbe, is working under the prin ciples of buddhi-yoga  and finds himself always in\\ntranscendental bliss. By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all\\ntranscendental understanding automati cally, by the grace of the Lord, and\\nthus his liberation is complete in itself, without his mak ing extraneous\\nendeavors to acquire knowledge. There is much difference between work in\\nKåñëa consciousness and work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of\\nsense gratification for achieving results in terms of family or material\\nhappiness.

Even a small beginning of such activity finds no impediment, nor can\\nthat small beginning be lost  at any stage. Any work begun on the material\\nplane has to be completed, otherwise th e whole attempt becomes a failure. But\\nany work begun in Kåñëa consciousness has a permanent effect, even though\\nnot finished. The performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his\\nwork in Kåñëa consciousness is inco mplete. One percent done in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness bears permanent results, so  that the next beginning is from the\\npoint of two percent, whereas in mater ial activity without a hundred percent\\nsuccess th ere is no profit. Ajämila performed his duty in some percentage of\\nKåñëa consciousness, but the result he enjoyed at the end was a hundred\\npercent, by the grace of the Lord. Ther e is a nice verse in this connection in\\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.5.17 ):\\ntyaktvä sva-dharmaà caraëämbujaà harer\\nbhajann apakvo ’tha patet tato yadi\\nyatra kva väbhadram abhüd amuñya kià\\nko värtha äpto ’bhajatäà sva-dharmataù\\n“If someone gives up his occupational duties and works in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness and then falls down on account of not completing his work,\\nwhat loss is there on his part?

But work in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness carries a person again to Kåñëa consciousness, even after the loss\\nof the body.

As such, to be wel l versed in Kåñëa consciousness one has to act\\nfirmly and obey the representative of Kåñëa, and one should accept the\\ninstruction of the bona fide spiritual master as one’s mission in life.

The Vedas  deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually\\nelevate the general pub lic from the field of sense gratification to a position on\\nthe transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Kåñëa, is\\nadvised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedänta  philosophy\\nwhere, in the beginning, there is brahma-ji jïäsä,  or questions on the supreme\\ntranscendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are\\nstruggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the\\nmaterial world, gave the Vedic wisdom  advising how to live and get rid of the\\nmaterial entanglement. When the activiti es for sense gratification, namely the\\nkarma-käëòa  chapter, are finished, then the ch ance for spiritual realization is\\noffered in the form of the Upaniñads,  which are part of different Vedas,  as the\\nBhagavad-g étä is a part of the fifth Veda,  namely the Mahäbhärata.  The\\nUpaniñads  mark the beginning of transcendental life.\\nAs long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the\\nmaterial modes.

In this Age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and not\\nadequately educated to understand Vedänta  philosophy; the best purpose of\\nVedänta  philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy  name of the\\nLord.

The\\nLord advised that Arjuna not be inacti ve, but that he perform his prescribed\\nduty without being attached to the result. One who is attached to the result of\\nhis work is also the cause of the action.

Gain or  victory are Kåñëa’s concern; Arjuna is\\nsimply advised to act according to th e dictation of Kåñëa. The following of\\nKåñëa’s dictation is real yoga,  and this is practiced in the process  called Kåñëa\\nconsciousness. By Kåñëa consciousness only can one give up the sense of\\nproprietorship. One has to become the se rvant of Kåñëa, or the servant of the\\nservant of Kåñëa. That is the righ t way to discharge duty in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness, which alon e can help one to act in yoga.\\nArjuna is a kñatriya,  and as such he is participating in the\\nvarëäçrama-dharma  institution. It is said in the Viñëu Puräëa  that in the\\nvarëäçrama-dharma,  the whole aim is to satisfy Viñëu. No one should satisfy\\nhimself, as is the rule in the material world , but one should satisfy Kåñëa.

The Bhägavatam  (10.14.58 ) says:\\nsamäñritä ye pada-pallava-plavaà\\nmahat-padaà puëya-yaço muräreù\\nbhavämbudhir vatsa-padaà paraà padaà\\npadaà padaà yad vipadäà na teñäm\\n“For one who has accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the\\nshelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as Mukunda, or the giver of\\nmukti,  the ocean of the material world is like the water contained in a calf’s\\nfootprint. paraà padam , or the place where there are no material miseries, or\\nVaikuëöha, is his goal, not the place wh ere there is danger in every step of\\nlife.”\\nOwing to ignorance, one does not kn ow that this material world is a\\nmiserable place where there are dangers at every step.

The miseries of life, na mely birth, death, old age and diseases,\\nare present everywhere within the material world. But o ne who understands\\nhis real constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the Lord, and thus\\nknows the position of the Personality of Godhead, engages himself in the\\ntranscendental loving service of the Lord. Consequently he becomes qualified\\nto enter  into the Vaikuëöha planets, where there is neither material, miserable\\nlife nor the influence of time and death.  To know one’s constitutional position\\nmeans to know also the sublime positi on of the Lord. One who wrongly thinks\\nthat the living entity’s pos ition and the Lord’s position are on the same level is\\nto be understood to be in darkness and therefore unable to engage himself in\\nthe devotional service of the Lord. He becomes a lord himself and thus paves\\nthe way for the repetition of birth and death.

When a person factually understands Kåñëa\\nand his relationship with Kåñëa, he naturally becomes completely indifferent\\nto the rituals of fruitive activities, even though an experienced brähmaëa.  Çré\\nMädhavendra Puré, a great devotee and äcärya  in the line of the devotees, says:\\nsandhyä-vandana bhadram astu bhavato bhoù snäna tubhyaà namo\\nbho deväù pitaraç ca tarpaëa-vidhau nähaà kñamaù kñamyatäm\\nyatra kväpi niñadya yädava-kulottamasya kaàsa-dviñaù\\nsmäraà smäram aghaà harämi tad alaà manye kim anyena me\\n“O my prayers three times a day, all glory to you.

He is called a muni  fixed in mind. Such a fully Kåñëa conscious\\nperson is not at all disturbed by the on slaughts of the threefold miseries, for he\\naccepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord, thinking  himself only worthy of\\nmore trouble due to his past misdeeds; and he sees that his miseries, by the\\ngrace of the Lord, are minimized to the lowest. Similarly, when he is happy he\\ngives credit to the Lord, thinking himself unworthy of the happiness; he\\nrealizes that it is due only to the Lord’s grace that he is in such a comfortable\\ncondition and able to render better serv ice to the Lord. And, for the service of\\nthe Lord, he is always daring and acti ve and is not influenced by attachment\\nor aversion.

Most people, however, are servants of the\\nsenses and are thus directed by the dict ation of the senses. That is the answer\\nto the question as to how the yogé is situated. The senses are compared to\\nvenomous serpents. They want to act ve ry loosely and without restriction. The\\nyogé, or the devotee, must be very strong  to control the serpents—like a snake\\ncharmer. He never allows them to act indepe ndently. There are many\\ninjunctions in the revealed scriptures; some of them are do-not’s, and some of\\nthem are do’s. Unless one is able to follo w the do’s and the do-not’s, restricting\\noneself from sense enjoyment, it is not possible to be firmly fixed in  Kåñëa\\nconsciousness. The best example, set here in, is the tortoise. The tortoise can at\\nany moment wind up his senses and exhibit them again at any time for\\nparticular purposes. Similarly, the sens es of the Kåñëa conscious persons are\\nu s e d  o n l y  f o r  s o m e  p articular purpose in the service of the Lord and are\\nwithdrawn otherwise. Arjuna is being ta ught here to use his senses for the\\nservice of the Lord, instead of for hi s own satisfaction. Keeping the senses\\nalways in the service of the Lord is the example se t by the analogy of the\\ntortoise, who keeps the senses within.\\nTEXT  59\\nivzYaa iviNavTaRNTae iNaraharSYa deihNa\" )\\nrSavJa| rSaae_PYaSYa Par& d*îa iNavTaRTae )) 59 ))Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The process of restrict ion from sense enjoyment by rules and\\nregulations is something like restricting a diseased person from certain types of\\neatables. The patient,  however, neither likes such restrictions nor loses his\\ntaste for eatables. Similarly, sense restriction by some spiritual process like\\nañöäìga-yoga,  in the matter of yama, niyama, äsana, präëäyäma, pratyähära,\\ndhäraëä, dhyäna,  etc., is recommended for les s intelligent persons who have no\\nbetter knowledge. But one who has tast ed the beauty of the Supreme Lord\\nKåñëa, in the course of his advancement in Kåñëa consciousness, no longer has\\na taste for dead, material things. Therefore, restrictions are there for  the less\\nintelligent neophytes in the spiritual ad vancement of life, but such restrictions\\nare only good until one actually has a taste for Kåñëa consciousness. When one\\nis actually Kåñëa conscious, he automatically loses his taste for pale things.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

As cited above, the great sage Durväsä Muni\\npicked a quarrel with M ahäräja Ambaréña, and Durväsä Muni unnecessarily\\nbecame angry out of pride and therefor e could not check his senses. On the\\nother hand, the king, although not as powerful a yogé as the sage, but a devotee\\nof the Lord, silently tolerated all the sage’s inju stices and thereby emerged\\nvictorious. The king was able to control his senses because of the following\\nqualifications, as mentioned in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (9.4.18–20 ):\\nsa vai manaù kåñëa-pädäravindayor\\nvacäàsi vaikuëöha-guëänuvarëane\\nkarau harer mandira-märjanädiñu\\nçrutià cakäräcyuta-sat-kathodaye\\nmukunda-liìgälaya-darçane dåçau\\ntad-bhåtya-gätra-sparçe ’ìga-saìgamam\\nghräëaà ca tat-päda-saroja-saurabhe\\nçrémat-tulasyä rasanäà tad-arpite\\npädau hareù kñetra-padänusarpaëe\\nçiro håñékeça-padäbhivandane\\nkämaà ca däsye na tu käma-kämyayä\\nyathottama-çloka-janäçrayä ratiù\\n“King Ambaréña fixed his mind on the lo tus feet of Lord Kåñëa, engaged his\\nwords in describing the abode of the Lo rd, his hands in cleansing the temple ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The senses require real engagements,\\nand if they are not engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord,\\nthey will certainly seek engag ement in the service of materialism. In the\\nmaterial world everyone, including Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä—to say\\nnothing of other demigods in the heavenly planets—is subjected to the\\ninfluence of sense objects, and the on ly method to get out of this puzzle of\\nmaterial existence is to become Kåñë a conscious. Lord Çiva was deep in\\nmeditation, but when Pärvaté agitated hi m for sense pleasure, he agreed to the\\nproposal, and as a result Kärtikeya wa s born. When Haridäsa Öhäkura was a\\nyoung devotee of the Lord, he  was similarly allured by the incarnation of\\nMäyä-devé, but Haridäsa easily passed the test because of his unalloyed\\ndevotion to Lord Kåñëa. As illustrate d in the above-mentioned verse of Çré\\nYämunäcärya, a sincere devotee of the Lord shuns all material se nse\\nenjoyment due to his higher taste for spiritual enjoyment in the association of\\nthe Lord.

For ex ample, for an impersonalist, the Lord,\\nor the Absolute, being impersonal, cannot eat. Whereas an impersonalist tries\\nto avoid good eatables, a devotee knows that Kåñëa is the supreme enjoye r and\\nthat He eats all that is offered to Him in devotion. So, after offering good\\neatables to the Lord, the devotee takes the remnants, called prasädam.  Thus\\neverything becomes spiritualized, and th ere is no danger of a downfall. The\\ndevotee takes prasäda m in Kåñëa consciousness, whereas the nondevotee\\nrejects it as material.

According to Buddhist philosophy, th ere is only void after the completion\\nof this material life, but Bhagavad-gétä  teaches differently . Actual life begins\\nafter the completion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is\\nsufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for\\npersons who are spiritually advanced , there is another life after this\\nmateriali stic life. Before ending this life , if one fortunately becomes Kåñëa\\nconscious, he at once attains the stage of brahma-nirväëa.

But\\nwithout being trained in the philosophy  of Kåñëa consciousness, it is not\\nadvisable to chant the holy name of Kå ñëa in a secluded place, where one may\\nacquire only cheap adoration from the i nnocent public. Arjuna also thought of\\nKåñëa consciousness or buddhi-yoga,  or intelligence in spiritual advancement\\nof knowledge, as something like retireme nt from active life and the practice of\\npenance and austerity at a secluded place. In other words, he wanted to\\nskillfully avoid the fighting by using Kåñëa consc iousness as an excuse. But as a\\nsincere student, he placed the matter before his master and questioned Kåñëa\\nas to his best course of action.

In this\\nverse, the Lord explains the same more clearly. Säìkhya-yoga,  or the analytical\\nstudy of the nature of spirit and matter , is the subject matter for persons whoCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The other class of men wo rk in Kåñëa consciousness, as it is\\nexplained in the 61st verse of the Second Chapter . The Lord has e xplained,\\nalso in the 39th verse , that by working by the principles of buddhi-yoga,  or\\nKåñëa consciousness, one can be reli eved from the bonds of action; and,\\nfurthermore, there is no flaw in the proc ess. The same principle is more clearly\\nexplained in the  61st verse —that this buddhi-yoga  is to depend entirely on the\\nSupreme (or more specifically, on Kåñëa) , and in this way all the senses can be\\nbrought under control very easily. Therefore, both the yogas  are\\ninterdependent, as religion and philosophy. Reli gion without philosophy is\\nsentiment, or sometimes fanaticism, while philosophy without religion is\\nmental speculation. The ultimate goal is Kåñëa, because the philosophers who\\nare also sincerely searching after the Ab solute Truth come in the end to Kåñëa\\nconsciousness. This is also stated in the Bhagavad-gétä.  The whole process is to\\nunderstand the real position of the se lf in relation to the Superself. The\\nindirect process is philosophical speculation, by which, gradually, one may\\ncome to the point of Kåñ ëa consciousness; and the other process is directly\\nconnecting with everything in Kåñëa cons ciousness. Of these two, the path of\\nKåñëa consciousness is better because it does not depend on purifying the\\nsenses by a philosophical process. Kåñëa consciousnes s is itself the purifying\\nprocess, and by the direct method of devotional service it is simultaneously\\neasy and sublime.\\nTEXT  4\\nNa k-MaR<aaMaNaarM>aaàEZk-MYa| Pauåzae_énuTae )\\nNa c SaNNYaSaNaadev iSaiÖ& SaMaiDaGaC^iTa )) 4 ))\\nna karmaëäm anärambhän\\nnaiñkarmyaà puruño ’çnute\\nna ca sannyasanäd eva\\nsiddhià samadhigacchatiCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

In the Vedic hymns it is said: patià viçvasyätmeçvaram.\\nTherefore, the Lord of the living en tities is the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead, Viñëu. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  also ( 2.4.20 ) Çréla Çukadeva\\nGosvämé describes the Lord as pati in so many ways:\\nçriyaù patir yajïa-patiù prajä-patir\\ndhiyäà patir loka-patir dharä-patiù\\npatir gatiç cändhaka-våñëi-sätvatäà\\nprasédatäà me bhagavän satäà patiù\\nThe prajä-pati  is Lord Viñëu, and He is the Lo rd of all living creatures, all\\nworlds, and all beauties, and the protec tor of everyone.

Their pleasures and displeasur es are dependent on the performance\\nof yajïas  by the human being. Some of the yajïas  are meant to satisfy\\nparticular demigods; but even in so doing, Lord Viñëu is worshiped  in all yajïas\\nas the chief beneficiary.

For one who cannot understand what\\nthe Personality of Godhead is, sacrif ice to the demigods is recommended.\\nAccording to the different material qualities of the persons con cerned,\\ndifferent types of yajïas  are recommended in the Vedas.  Worship of different\\ndemigods is also on the same basis—namely, according to different qualities.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.For example, the meat-eaters are reco mmended to worship the goddess Kälé,\\nthe ghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess the sacrifice of\\nanimals is recommended. But for those wh o are in the mode of goodness, the\\ntranscendental worship of Viñëu is  recommended. But ultimately all yajïas  are\\nmeant for gradual promotion to the transcenden tal position. For ordinary\\nmen, at least five yajïas,  known as païca-mahä-yajïa,  are necessary.\\nOne should know, however, that all the necessities of life that the human\\nsociety requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one can\\nmanufacture anything. Take, for example,  all the eatables of human society.\\nThese eatables include grains,  fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar, etc., for the\\npersons in the mode of goodness, and al so eatables for the nonvegetarians, like\\nmeats, none of which can be manufact ured by men. Then again, take for\\nexample heat, light, water, ai r, etc., which are also nece ssities of life—none of\\nthem can be manufactured by the huma n society. Without the Supreme Lord,\\nthere can be no profuse sunlight, moonlight, rainfall, breeze, etc., without\\nwhich no one can live. Obviously, our life is dependent on supplies from the\\nLord.  Even for our manufacturing enterprises, we require so many raw\\nmaterials like metal, sulphur, mercury, manganese, and so many essentials—all\\nof which are supplied by the agents of  the Lord, with the purpose that we\\nshould make proper use of them to keep o urselves fit and healthy for the\\npurpose of self-realization, leading to  the ultimate goal of life, namely,\\nliberation from the material struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained\\nby performance of yajïas.  If we forget the purpose of human life a nd simply\\ntake supplies from the agents of the Lord for sense gratification and become\\nmore and more entangled in material existence, which is not the purpose of\\ncreation, certainly we become thieves, and therefore we are punished by the\\nlaws of material n ature. A society of thieves can never be happy, because they\\nhave no aim in life. The gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life.\\nThey are simply directed to sense gratification; nor do they have knowledge of\\nhow to perform yajïas.  Lord Caitan ya, however, inaugurated the easiest\\nperformance of yajïa,  namely the saìkértana-yajïa,  which can be performed by\\nanyone in the world who accepts the principles of Kåñëa consciousness.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The Supreme Lord,\\nwho is known as the yajïa-puruña,  or the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices,\\nis the master of all the demigods, who serve Him as the diff erent limbs of the\\nbody serve the whole. Demigods like In dra, Candra and Varuëa are appointed\\nofficers who manage material affairs, and the Vedas  direct sacrifices to satisfy\\nthese demigods so that they may be pleased to supply air, light and water\\nsuffici ently to produce food grains. When  Lord Kåñëa is worshiped, the\\ndemigods, who are different limbs of the Lord, are also automatically\\nworshiped; therefore there is no separate need to worship the demigods. For\\nthis reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are  in Kåñëa consciousness, offer\\nfood to Kåñëa and then eat—a process which nourishes the body spiritually. By\\nsuch action not only are past sinful re actions in the body vanquished, but the\\nbody becomes immunized to all cont amination of material nature. When  there\\nis an epidemic disease, an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack\\nof such an epidemic. Similarly, food offered to Lord Viñëu and then taken by\\nus makes us sufficiently resistant to material affection, and one who is\\naccustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person\\nin Kåñëa consciousness, who eats only f ood offered to Kåñëa, can counteract all\\nreactions of past material infections, which are impediments to the progress of\\nself-realization. On the other han d, one who does not do so continues to\\nincrease the volume of sinful action , and this prepares the next body to\\nresemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins. The\\nmaterial world is full of contamin ations, and one who is immunized by\\naccepting prasädam  of the Lord (food offered to Viñëu) is saved from the\\nattack, whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination.\\nFood grains or vegetables are factually eatables.

Therefore, ultimately, we have to\\ndepend on the production of the fiel d and not on the production of big\\nfactories. The field production is due to sufficient rain  from the sky, and such\\nrains are controlled by demigods like In dra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all\\nservants of the Lord. The Lord can be satisfied by sacrifices; therefore, one\\nwho cannot perform them will find hims elf in scarcity—that is the law of\\nnature. Yajïa,  specifically the saìkértana-yajïa  prescribed for this age, must\\ntherefore be performed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply.\\nTEXT  15\\nk-MaR b]øaeÙv& iviÖ b]øa+arSaMauÙvMa( )\\nTaSMaaTSavRGaTa& b]ø iNaTYa& Yaje Pa[iTaiïTaMa( )) 15 ))\\nkarma brahmodbhavaà viddhi\\nbrahmäkñara-samudbhavam\\ntasmät sarva-gataà brahma\\nnityaà yajïe pratiñöhitam\\nSYNONYMS\\nkarma —work; brahma —from the Vedas;  udbhavam —produced; viddhi —you\\nshould know; brahma —the Vedas;  akñara —from the Supreme Brahman\\n(Personality of Godhead); samudbhavam —directly manifested;\\ntasmät —therefore; sarva-gatam —all-pervading; brahma —transcendence;\\nnityam —eternally; yajïe —in sacrifice; pratiñöhitam —situated.\\nTRANSLATION\\nRegulated activities are prescribed in the Vedas, and the Vedas are directly\\nmanifested from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

The Vedas  are therefore codes of\\nworking directions. Anything perfor med without the direction of the Vedas  is\\ncalled vikarma,  or unauthorized or sinful work. Therefore, one should always\\ntake direction from the Vedas  to be saved from the rea ction of work. As one\\nhas to work in ordinary life by the di rection of the state, one similarly has to\\nwork under direction of the supreme stat e of the Lord. Such directions in the\\nVedas  are directly manifested from the breathing of the Supreme Personality\\nof Godhead. It is said, asya mahato bhütasya niçvasitam etad yad åg-vedo\\nyajur-vedaù sämavedo ’tharväìgirasaù.  “The four Vedas —namely the Åg Veda,\\nYajur Veda, Säma Veda,  and Atharva Veda —are all emanations from the\\nbreathing of the great Personality of Go dhead.” ( Båhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad\\n4.5.11 ) The Lord, being omnipotent, can sp eak by breathing air, for as it is\\nconfirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä,  the Lord has the omnipotence to perform\\nthrough each of His senses the actions of all other senses. In other word s, the\\nLord can speak through His breathing, and He can impregnate by His eyes. In\\nfact, it is said that He glanced over ma terial nature and thus fathered all living\\nentities. After creating or impregnating the conditioned souls into the womb\\nof material n ature, He gave His directions in  the Vedic wisdom as to how such\\nconditioned souls can return home, ba ck to Godhead. We should always\\nremember that the conditioned souls in  material nature are all eager for\\nmaterial enjoyment. But the Vedic directions are so made that one can satisfy\\none’s perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having finished his so-called\\nenjoyment. It is a chance for the co nditioned souls to attain liberation;\\ntherefore the conditioned souls must try to follow the process of yajïa  by\\nbecoming Kåñëa conscious. Even those who have not followed the Vedic\\ninjunctions may adopt the principles of Kåñëa consciousness, and that will take\\nthe place of performance of Vedic yajïas,  or karmas.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The Lord\\ninstructs that one has to become fully Kå ñëa conscious to discharge duties, as if\\nin military discipline. Such an injunction may make things a little difficult;\\nnevertheless duties mus t be carried out, with dependence on Kåñëa, because\\nthat is the constitutional position of th e living entity. The living entity cannot\\nbe happy independent of the cooperat ion of the Supreme Lord, because the\\neternal constitutional position of the living en tity is to become subordinate to\\nthe desires of the Lord. Arjuna was theref ore ordered by Çré Kåñëa to fight as if\\nthe Lord were his military commander. On e has to sacrifice everything for the\\ngood will of the Supreme Lord, and at the same time discharge p rescribed\\nduties without claiming proprietorship. Arjuna did not have to consider the\\norder of the Lord; he had only to exec ute His order. The Supreme Lord is the\\nsoul of all souls; therefore, one who depends solely and wholly on the Supreme\\nSoul without p ersonal consideration, or in other words, one who is fully Kåñëa\\nconscious, is called adhyätma-cetas.  Niräçéù  means that one has to act on the\\norder of the master but should not expe ct fruitive results. The cashier may\\ncount millions of dollars for his emp loyer, but he does not claim a cent for\\nhimself. Similarly, one has to realize th at nothing in the world belongs to any\\nindividual person, but that everything belongs to the Supreme Lord. That is\\nthe real purport of mayi,  or “unto Me.” And when one acts in  such Kåñëa\\nconsciousness, certainly he does not cl aim proprietorship over anything.

There are many so-called\\nspiritualists who outwardly pose as advanced in the science but inwardly  or\\nprivately are completely under particular modes of nature which they are\\nunable to surpass. Academically, one may be very learned, but because of his\\nlong association with material nature, he is in bondage. Kåñëa consciousness\\nhelps one to get out of t he material entanglement, even though one may be\\nengaged in his prescribed duties in te rms of material existence. Therefore,\\nwithout being fully in Kåñëa consciousness, one should not give up his\\noccupational duties. No one should suddenly give up his pres cribed duties and\\nbecome a so-called yogé or transcendentalist artificially. It is better to be\\nsituated in one’s position and to tr y to attain Kåñëa consciousness under\\nsuperior training.

But those who are not in such consciousness\\nshould follow the rules and regulations of  the revealed scriptures. Unrestricted\\nsense enjoyment is the caus e of material encagement, but one who follows the\\nrules and regulations of the revealed sc riptures does not become entangled by\\nthe sense objects. For example, se x enjoyment is a necessity for the\\nconditioned soul, and sex enjo yment is allowed under the li cense of marriage\\nties. According to scriptural injunction s, one is forbidden to engage in sex\\nrelationships with any women other than one’s wife. All other women are to\\nbe considered as one’s mother. But in sp ite of such injunctions, a man is still\\ninclin ed to have sex relationships with other women. These propensities are to\\nbe curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of\\nself-realization. As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the\\nmaterial body are allowed, but under rules and regulations. And yet, we should\\nnot rely upon the control of such allo wances. One has to follow those rules and\\nregulations, unattached to them, becaus e practice of sense gratification under\\nregulations may also lead one to go astray—as much as t here is always the\\nchance of an accident, even on the ro yal roads. Although they may be very\\ncarefully maintained, no one can guaran tee that there will be no danger evenCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.on the safest road. The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long,\\nlong time , owing to material association. Therefore, in spite of regulated sense\\nenjoyment, there is every chance of falling down; therefore any attachment\\nfor regulated sense enjoyment must also be avoided by all means. But\\nattachment to Kåñëa consciousness, or ac ting always in the loving service of\\nKåñëa, detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities. Therefore, no one\\nshould try to be detached from Kåñëa consciousness at any stage of life.

Materially, prescribed\\nduties are duties enjoined according to  one’s psychophysical condition, under\\nthe spell of the modes of materia l nature. Spiritual duties are as ordered by the\\nspiritual master for the transcendental service of Kåñëa. But whether material\\nor spiritual, one should stick to his prescribed duties even up to death, rather\\nthan imitate another’s prescribed duties. Dutie s on the spiritual platform and\\nduties on the material platform may be  different, but the principle of following\\nthe authorized direction is always good  for the performer. When one is under\\nthe spell of the modes of material  nature, one should follow the p rescribed\\nrules for his particular situation and sh ould not imitate others. For example, a\\nbrähmaëa,  who is in the mode of goodness, is nonviolent, whereas a kñatriya,\\nwho is in the mode of passion, is allowed to be violent. As such, for a kñatriya  it\\nis better to be vanquished following the rules of violence than to imitate a\\nbrähmaëa  who follows the principles of nonv iolence. Everyone has to cleanse\\nhis heart by a gradual process, not abruptly. However, when one transcends\\nthe modes of material nature and  is fully situated in Kåñëa consciousness, he\\ncan perform anything and everything under the direction of a bona fide\\nspiritual master. In that complete stage of Kåñëa consciousness, the kñatriya\\nmay act as a brähmaëa,  or a brähmaëa  may act as a kñatriya.  In the\\ntranscendental stage, the distinctions of  the material world do not apply. For\\nexample, Viçvämitra was originally a kñatriya,  but later on he acted as a\\nbrähmaëa,  whereas Paraçuräma was a brähmaëa  but later on he acted as a\\nkñatriya.  Being transcende ntally situated, they could do so; but as long as one is\\non the material platform, he must perf orm his duties according to the modes of\\nmaterial nature. At the same time, he must have a full sense of Kåñëa\\nconsciousness.\\nTEXT  36Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Therefore, lust is theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Wrath is the\\nmanifestation of the mode of ignoranc e; these modes exhibit themselves as\\nwrath and other corollaries. If, therefor e, the mode of passion, instead of b eing\\ndegraded into the mode of ignorance, is elevated to the mode of goodness by\\nthe prescribed method of living and acting, then one can be saved from the\\ndegradation of wrath by spiritual attachment.\\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead ex panded Himself into many for His\\never-increasing spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels of\\nthis spiritual bliss. They also have part ial independence, but by misuse of their\\nindependence, when the  service attitude is transformed into the propensity for\\nsense enjoyment, they come under the sw ay of lust. This material creation is\\ncreated by the Lord to give facility to  the conditioned souls to fulfill these\\nlustful propensities, and when completely b affled by prolonged lustful\\nactivities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position.\\nThis inquiry is the beginning of the Vedänta-sütras,  wherein it is said,\\nathäto brahma jijïäsä : one should inquire into th e Supreme.

This covering is but lust under different\\nmanifestations like smoke in the fire, dust on the mirror, and the womb about\\nthe embryo. When lust is compared to smoke, it is understood that the fire of\\nthe living spark can be a little percei ved. In other words, when the living\\nentity exhibits his Kåñëa consciousness slightly, he may be likened to the fire\\ncovered by smoke. Although fire is necessary where there  is smoke, there is no\\novert manifestation of fire in the early st age. This stage is like the beginning of\\nKåñëa consciousness. The dust on the mirror refers to a cleansing process of\\nthe mirror of the mind by so many sp iritual methods. The best process is  to\\nchant the holy names of the Lord. Th e embryo covered by the womb is an\\nanalogy illustrating a helpless position, fo r the child in the womb is so helplessCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The  trees are also living entities, but they have been put in\\nsuch a condition of life by such a great exhibition of lust that they are almost\\nvoid of all consciousness. The covere d mirror is compared to the birds and\\nbeasts, and the smoke-covered fire is com pared to the human being. In the\\nform of a human being, the living  entity may revive a little Kåñëa\\nconsciousness, and, if he makes further development, the fire of spiritual life\\ncan be kindled in the human form of li fe. By careful handling of the smoke i n\\nthe fire, fire can be made to blaze. Therefore the human form of life is a\\nchance for the living entity to escape the entanglement of material existence.\\nIn the human form of life, one can conq uer the enemy, lust, by cultivation of\\nKåñëa consciousness un der able guidance.\\nTEXT  39\\nAav*Ta& jaNaMaeTaeNa jaiNaNaae iNaTYavEir<aa )\\nk-aMaæPae<a k-aENTaeYa duZPaUre<aaNale/Na c )) 39 ))\\nävåtaà jïänam etena\\njïänino nitya-vairiëä\\nkäma-rüpeëa kaunteya\\nduñpüreëänalena ca\\nSYNONYMS\\nävåtam —covered; jïänam —pure consciousness; etena —by this; jïäninaù —of\\nthe knower; nitya-vairiëä —by the eternal enemy; käma-rüpeëa —in the form\\nof lust; kaunteya —O son of Kunté; duñpüreëa —never to be satisfied;\\nanalena —by the fire; ca—also.\\nTRANSLATION\\nThus the wise living entity’s pure consciousness becomes covered by his\\neternal enemy in the form of lust, which is never satisfied and which burns likeCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Advancement of\\nmaterial civilization on the basis of  sense gratification means increasing the\\nduration of the material existence of a li ving entity.

Lust is reserved\\nwithin the body, but it is given vent through the senses. Therefore, the senses\\nare superior to the body as a whole. Th ese outlets are not in use when there is\\nsuperior conscious ness, or Kåñëa consciousness. In Kåñëa consciousness the\\nsoul makes direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead;\\ntherefore the hierarchy of bodily functions, as described here, ultimately ends\\nin the Supreme Soul. Bodily action means the func tions of the senses, and\\nstopping the senses means stopping all bodily actions. But since the mind is\\nactive, then even though the body may be silent and at rest, the mind will\\nact—as it does during dreaming. But above the mind is the determination of\\nthe intelligence, and above the intelligence is the soul proper. If, therefore, the\\nsoul is directly engaged with the Supr eme, naturally all other subordinates,\\nnamely, the intelligence, mind and senses, will be automatically engaged. In\\nthe Kaöha Upaniñad  there is a similar passage, in which it is said that the\\nobjects of sense gratification are superior  to the senses, and mind is superior to\\nthe sense objects. If, therefore, the mind  is directly engaged in the service of\\nthe Lord constantly, then there is no chance that the senses will become\\nengaged in other ways.

Therefore, directly understanding the constitutional position of\\nthe soul i s the solution of the whole problem.\\nWith intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul\\nand then engage the mind always in Kåñëa consciousness. That solves the\\nwhole problem. A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from\\nthe objects of the senses.

In the material existence o f life, one is certainly influenced by\\npropensities for lust and desire for dominating the resources of material\\nnature. Desire for overlording and for sense gratification is the greatest enemy\\nof the conditioned soul; but by the strength of Kåñëa consciou sness, one can\\ncontrol the material senses, the mind and the intelligence. One may not give\\nup work and prescribed duties all of a sudden; but by gradually developing\\nKåñëa consciousness, one can be situated  in a transcendental position without\\nbeing influ enced by the material senses and the mind—by steady intelligence\\ndirected toward one’s pure identity. This is the sum total of this chapter. In the\\nimmature stage of material existence, philosophical speculations and artificial\\nattempts to control the sens es by the so-called practice of yogic postures can\\nnever help a man toward spiritual life. He must be trained in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness by higher intelligence.\\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Third Chapter of the Çrémad\\nBhagavad-gétä  in the matter of Karma-yoga,  or the Discharge of One’s Prescribed\\nDuty in Kåñëa Consciousness.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Human life is meant for cultivation of spiritual\\nknowledge, in eternal relationship with the Suprem e Personality of Godhead,\\nand the executive heads of all states an d all planets are obliged to impart this\\nlesson to the citizens by education, cu lture and devotion. In other words, the\\nexecutive heads of all states are in tended to spread the science of Kå ñëa\\nconsciousness so that the people may ta ke advantage of this great science and\\npursue a successful path, utilizing the opportunity of the human form of life.\\nIn this millennium, the sun-god is know n as Vivasvän, the king of the sun,\\nwhich is the origin of all planet s within the solar system. In the\\nBrahma-saàhitä  (5.52) it is stated:\\nyac-cakñur eña savitä sakala-grahäëäà\\nräjä samasta-sura-mürtir açeña-tejäù\\nyasyäjïayä bhramati sambhåta-käla-cakro\\ngovindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi\\n“Let me worship,” Lord Brahmä said, “the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\\nGovinda [Kåñëa], who is the original person and under whose order the sun,\\nwhich is the king of all planets, is assuming immense power and heat.

He is rotati ng under the order of Kåñëa, and Lord\\nKåñëa originally made Vivasvän  His first disciple to understand the science of\\nBhagavad-gétä.

Manu,\\nbeing the father of mankind, gave it to  his son Mahäräja Ikñväku, the king of\\nthis earth planet and forefathe r of the Raghu dynasty, in which Lord\\nRämacandra appeared.” Therefore, Bhagavad-gétä  existed in human society\\nfrom the time of Mahäräja Ikñväku.\\nAt the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of\\nthe Kali-yuga, which lasts 432,000 years. Before this there was Dväpara-yuga\\n(800,000 years), and before that there was Tretä-yuga (1,200,000 years). Thus,\\nsome 2,005,000 years ago, M anu spoke the Bhagavad-gétä  to his disciple and son\\nMahäräja Ikñväku, the king of this pl anet earth. The age of the current Manu\\nis calculated to last some 305,3 00,000 years, of which 120,400,000 have passed.\\nAccepting that before the birth of Manu the Gétä was spoken by the Lord to\\nHis disciple the sun-god Vivasvän, a rough estimate is that the Gétä was spoken\\nat least 120,400,000 years ago; and in huma n society it has been extant for two\\nmillion years. It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about fiv e thousand\\nyears ago. That is the rough es timate of the history of the Gétä,  according to\\nthe Gétä itself and according to the versio n of the speaker, Lord Çré Kåñëa. It\\nwas spoken to the sun-god Vivasvän because he is also a kñatriya  and is the\\nfather of all kñatriyas  who are descendants of the sun-god, or the sürya-vaàça\\nkñatriyas.  Because Bhagavad-gétä  is as good as the Vedas,  being spoken by the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is apauruñeya,  superhuman.\\nSince the Vedic instructions are ac cepted as they are, without humanCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The mundane wranglers may speculate on the Gétä in their\\nown ways, but that is not Bhagavad-gétä  as it is. Therefore, Bhagavad-gétä  has to\\nbe accepted as it is, from the discip lic succession, and it is described herein\\nthat the Lord spoke to the sun-god, the sun-god spoke to his son Manu and\\nManu spoke to his son Ikñväku.\\nTEXT  2\\nWv& ParMParaPa[aáiMaMa& raJazRYaae ivdu\" )\\nSa k-ale/Naeh MahTaa YaaeGaae Naí\" ParNTaPa )) 2 ))\\nevaà paramparä-präptam\\nimaà räjarñayo viduù\\nsa käleneha mahatä\\nyogo nañöaù parantapa\\nSYNONYMS\\nevam —thus; paramparä —by disciplic succession; präptam —received;\\nimam —this science; räja-åñayaù —the saintly kings; viduù —understood;\\nsaù—that knowledge; kälena —in the course of time; iha—in this world;\\nmahatä —great; yogaù —the science of one’s relationship w ith the Supreme;\\nnañöaù —scattered; parantapa —O Arjuna, subduer of the enemies.\\nTRANSLATION\\nThis supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic\\nsuccession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way.

Certainly\\nBhagavad-gétä  was never meant for the demonic persons, who would dissipate\\nits value for no one’s benefit and would devise all types of interpretations\\naccording to personal whims. As soon as the original purpose was scattered by\\nthe motives of the unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to\\nreestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand ye ars ago it was detected by\\nthe Lord Himself that the disciplic succession was broken, and therefore He\\ndeclared that the purpose of the Gétä appeared to be lost. In the same way, at\\nthe present moment also there are so many editions of the Gétä (especially  in\\nEnglish), but almost all of them are not according to authorized disciplic\\nsuccession. There are innumerable interpretations rendered by different\\nmundane scholars, but almost all of them do not accept the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead, Kåñëa, althoug h they make a good business on the\\nwords of Çré Kåñëa. This spirit is demonic, because demons do not believe in\\nGod but simply enjoy the property of th e Supreme. Since there is a great need\\nof an edition of the Gétä in English, as it is received by the paramparä\\n(disciplic succession) system, an attempt is  made herewith to fulfill this great\\nwant.

The fact is that Arjuna  is not inquiring for himself but for\\nthose who do not believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead or for the\\ndemons who do not like the idea tha t Kåñëa should be accepted as the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead; for them only Arjuna inquires on this point, as if he\\nwere himself not aware of the Personality of Godhead, or Kåñëa. As it will be\\nevident from the Tenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well  that Kåñëa is the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, the fo untainhead of everything and the last\\nword in transcendence. Of course, Kåñëa also appeared as the son of Devaké on\\nthis earth. How Kåñëa remained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead,\\nthe eternal  original person, is very difficult for an ordinary man to understand.\\nTherefore, to clarify this point, Arjuna  put this question before Kåñëa so thatCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.He Himself could speak authoritatively. That Kåñëa is the supreme authority is\\naccepted by the whole worl d, not only at present but from time immemorial,\\nand the demons alone reject Him. An yway, since Kåñëa is the authority\\naccepted by all, Arjuna put this questi on before Him in order that Kåñëa would\\ndescribe Himself without being depicted by the demons, who  always try to\\ndistort Him in a way understandable to the demons and their followers. It is\\nnecessary that everyone, for his own interest, know the science of Kåñëa.\\nTherefore, when Kåñëa Himself speaks ab out Himself, it is auspicious for all\\nthe worlds. T o the demons, such explanations by Kåñëa Himself may appear to\\nbe strange because the demons always study Kåñëa from their own standpoint,\\nbut those who are devotees heartily welcome the statements of Kåñëa when\\nthey are spoken by Kåñëa Himself. The devote es will always worship such\\nauthoritative statements of Kåñëa becaus e they are always eager to know more\\nand more about Him. The atheists, who consider Kåñëa an ordinary man, may\\nin this way come to know that Kåñëa is superhuman, that He is\\nsac-cid-änanda- vigraha  [Bs. 5.1]—the eternal form of bliss and\\nknowledge—that He is transcendental, and that He is above the domination\\nof the modes of material nature and ab ove the influence of time and space. A\\ndevotee of Kåñëa, like Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any mi sunderstanding of\\nthe transcendental position of Kåñëa. Ar juna’s putting this question before the\\nLord is simply an attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of\\npersons who consider Kåñëa to be an ordinary human being, subject to the\\nmodes of m aterial nature.\\nTEXT  5\\né[q>aGavaNauvac\\nbhUiNa Mae VYaTaqTaaiNa JaNMaaiNa Tav caJauRNa )\\nTaaNYah& ved SavaRi<a Na Tv& veTQa ParNTaPa )) 5 ))\\nçré-bhagavän uväca\\nbahüni me vyatétäni\\njanmäni tava cärjunaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

He is like the vaidurya  stone, which\\nchanges color yet still remains one. All those multiforms are understood by the\\npure, unalloyed devotees , but not by a simple study of the Vedas  (vedeñu\\ndurlabham adurlabham ätma-bhaktau ). Devotees like Arjuna are constant\\ncompanions of the Lord, and whenever  the Lord incarnates, the associate\\ndevotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different c apacities.\\nArjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some\\nmillions of years ago when Lord Kåñëa spoke the Bhagavad-gétä  to the sun-god\\nVivasvän, Arjuna, in a different capacity , was also present. But the difference\\nbetween th e Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incident\\nwhereas Arjuna could not remember. That is the difference between the\\npart-and-parcel living entity and th e Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is\\naddressed herein as the mighty hero who could subdue the  enemies, he is\\nunable to recall what had happened in his various past births. Therefore, a\\nliving entity, however great he may be in the material estimation, can never\\nequal the Supreme Lord. Anyone who is a constant companion of the Lord is\\ncertainly a l iberated person, but he cannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is\\ndescribed in the Brahma-saàhitä  as infallible ( acyuta ), which means that He\\nnever forgets Himself, even though He is  in material contact. Therefore, the\\nLord and the living entity can never b e equal in all respects, even if the living\\nentity is as liberated as Arjuna. Althou gh Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he\\nsometimes forgets the nature of the Lord , but by the divine grace a devotee can\\nat once understand the infallible condition of the Lo rd, whereas a nondevotee\\nor a demon cannot understand this tran scendental nature. Consequently these\\ndescriptions in the Gétä cannot be understood by demonic brains. Kåñëa\\nremembered acts which were performed by Him millions of years before, but\\nArjuna cou ld not, despite the fact that both Kåñëa and Arjuna are eternal inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

He is advaita,  which means there is no distinction\\nbetween His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is\\nspirit—whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And\\nbecause the Lord’s body and self are iden tical, His position is always different\\nfrom that of the ordinary living entity , even when He descends to the material\\nplatform. The demons cannot adjust them selves to this transcendental nature\\nof the Lord, which the Lord Himself explains in the following verse.\\nTEXT  6\\nAJaae_iPa SaàVYaYaaTMaa >aUTaaNaaMaqìrae_iPa SaNa( )\\nPa[k*-iTa& SvaMaiDaïaYa SaM>avaMYaaTMaMaaYaYaa )) 6 ))\\najo ’pi sann avyayätmä\\nbhütänäm éçvaro ’pi san\\nprakåtià sväm adhiñöhäya\\nsambhavämy ätma-mäyayä\\nSYNONYMS\\najaù—unborn; api—although; san—being so; avyaya —without deterioration;\\nätmä —body; bhütänäm —of all those who are born; éçvaraù —the Supreme\\nLord; api—although; san—being so; prakåtim —in the transcendental form;\\nsväm —of Myself; adhiñöhäya —being so situated; sambhavämi —I do incarnate;\\nätma-mäyayä —by My internal energy.\\nTRANSLATION\\nAlthough I am unborn and My transc endental body never deteriorates, and\\nalthough I am the Lord of all living entities, I still appear in every millennium\\nin My original transcendental form.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.PURPORT\\nThe Lord has spoken about the peculiar ity of His birth: although He may\\nappear like an ordinary person, He remembers everything of His many, many\\npast “births,” whereas a common man cannot remember what he has done\\neven a few hours before. If someone is as ked what he did exactly at the same\\ntime one day earlier, it would be very  difficult for a common man to answer\\nimmediately. He would surely have to dr edge his memory to recall what he was\\ndoing exactly at the same time on e day before. And yet, men often d are claim\\nto be God, or Kåñëa. One should not be misled by such meaningless claims.\\nThen again, the Lord explains His prakåti,  or His form. Prakåti  means “nature,”\\nas well as svarüpa,  or “one’s own form.” The Lord says that He appears in His\\nown body. He d oes not change His body, as the common living entity changes\\nfrom one body to another. The conditione d soul may have one kind of body in\\nthe present birth, but he has a different body in the next birth. In the material\\nworld, the living entity has no fixed  body but transmigrates from one body to\\nanother. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so\\nin the same original body, by His inte rnal potency. In other words, Kåñëa\\nappears in this material world in  His original eternal form, with  two hands,\\nholding a flute. He appears exactly in  His eternal body, uncontaminated by\\nthis material world. Although He appear s in the same transcendental body and\\nis Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary\\nliving en tity. And although His body does not deteriorate like a material body,\\nit still appears that Lord Kåñëa grow s from childhood to boyhood and from\\nboyhood to youth. But astonishingly en ough He never ages beyond youth. At\\nthe time of the Battle of Kurukñetra,  He had many grandchildren at home; or,\\nin other words, He had sufficiently aged by material calculations. Still He\\nlooked just like a young man twenty or  twenty-five years old. We never see a\\npicture of Kåñëa in old age beca use He never grows old like us,  although He is\\nthe oldest person in the whole creation —past, present, and future. Neither His\\nbody nor His intelligence ever deteriorates  or changes. Therefore, it is clear\\nthat in spite of His being in the material  world, He is the same unborn, eternal\\nform of bliss and knowledge, changele ss in His transcendental body andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

When the\\nsun is out of sight, we think that  the sun is set, and when the sun is before our\\neyes, we think that the sun is on the hori zon. Actually, the sun is always in its\\nfixed position, but owing to our defectiv e, insufficient senses, we calculate the\\nappearance and disappearance of the sun in t he sky. And because Lord Kåñëa’s\\nappearance and disappearance are completely different from that of any\\nordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He is eternal, blissful\\nknowledge by His internal potency—and He is never contaminated by\\nmaterial na ture. The Vedas  also confirm that the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead is unborn yet He still appears to take His birth in\\nmultimanifestations. The Vedic supplem entary literatures also confirm that\\neven though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is s till without change\\nof body. In the Bhägavatam,  He appears before His mother as Näräyaëa, with\\nfour hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences. His\\nappearance in His original eternal form is His causeless mercy, bestowed upon\\nthe living e ntities so that they can concentrat e on the Supreme Lord as He is,\\nand not on mental concoctions or im aginations, which the impersonalist\\nwrongly thinks the Lord’s forms to be. The word mäyä,  or ätma-mäyä,  refers to\\nthe Lord’s causeless mercy, according to  the Viçva-koça  dictionary. The Lord is\\nconscious of all of His previous appearances and disappearances, but a common\\nliving entity forgets everything about his past body as soon as he gets another\\nbody. He is the Lord of all living entities because He per forms wonderful and\\nsuperhuman activities while He is on th is earth. Therefore, the Lord is always\\nthe same Absolute Truth and is withou t differentiation between His form and\\nself, or between His quality and body.

Såjämi  cannot be used in the sense of\\ncreation, because, according to the previous verse, there is no creation of the\\nLord’s form or body, since all of the forms are eternally existent. Therefore,\\nsåjämi  means that th e Lord manifests Himself as He is. Although the Lord\\nappears on schedule, namely at th e end of the Dväpara-yuga of the\\ntwenty-eighth millennium of the seventh Manu in one day of Brahmä, He has\\nno obligation to adhere to such rules and regulations, because He is completely\\nfree to act in many ways at His will.  He therefore appears by His own will\\nwhenever there is a predominance of irreligiosity and a disappearance of true\\nreligion. Principles of religion are laid down in the Vedas,  and any discrepancy\\nin th e matter of properly executing the rules of the Vedas  makes one\\nirreligious. In the Bhägavatam  it is stated that such principles are the laws ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.the Lord. Only the Lord can manufa cture a system of religion. The Vedas  are\\nalso accepted as originally spoken by the Lord Himself to Brahmä, from within\\nhis heart. Therefore, the principles of dharma,  or religion, are the direct orders\\nof the Supreme Personality of Godhead ( dharmaà tu säkñäd bhagavat-praëétam\\n[SB 6.3.19 ]). These principles are clearly indicated th roughout the\\nBhagavad-gétä.  The purpose of the Vedas  is to establish such principles under\\nthe order of the Supreme Lord, and the Lo rd directly orders, at the end of the\\nGétä,  that the highest principle of religion  is to surrender unto Him only, and\\nnothin g more. The Vedic principles push one towards complete surrender unto\\nHim; and whenever such principles ar e disturbed by the demoniac, the Lord\\nappears. From the Bhägavatam  we understand that Lord Buddha is the\\nincarnation of Kåñëa who appeared when materi alism was rampant and\\nmaterialists were using the pretext of the authority of the Vedas.  Although\\nthere are certain restrictive rules and re gulations regarding animal sacrifice for\\nparticular purposes in the Vedas,  people of demonic tendency still took to\\nanimal sacrifice without reference to  the Vedic principles. Lord Buddha\\nappeared to stop this nonsense and to establish the Vedic principles of\\nnonviolence. Therefore each and every avatära,  or incarnation of the Lord,\\nhas a particular mission, and they ar e all described in the revealed scriptures.\\nNo one should be accepted as an avatära  unless he is referred to by scriptures.\\nIt is not a fact that the Lord appears only on Indian soil. He can manifest\\nHimself anywhere and everywhere, and whenever He desires  to appear. In\\neach and every incarnation, He speaks as much about religion as can be\\nunderstood by the particular people under their particular circumstances. But\\nthe mission is the same—to lead people  to God consciousness and obedience to\\nthe principles of religion. Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes\\nHe sends His bona fide representative in  the form of His son, or servant, or\\nHimself in some disguised form.\\nThe principles of the Bhagavad-gétä  were spoken to Arjuna, and, for that\\nmatter, to other highly elevated persons, because he was highly advanced\\ncompared to ordinary persons in other parts of the world. Two plus two equals\\nfour is a mathematical principle  that is true in the beginner’s arithmetic class\\nand in the advanced class as well. Still, there are higher and lowerCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.mathematics. In all incarnations of the Lord, therefore, the same principles are\\ntaught, but they appear to be higher and lower in varied circumstances. The\\nhigher principles of religion begin with  the acceptance of the four orders and\\nthe four statuses of social life, as wi ll be explained later. The whole purpose of\\nthe mission of incarnations is to ar ouse Kåñëa consciousness everywhere. Su ch\\nconsciousness is manifest and nonmanifest only under different circumstances.\\nTEXT  8\\nPair}aa<aaYa SaaDaUNaa& ivNaaXaaYa c duZk*-TaaMa( )\\nDaMaRSa&SQaaPaNaaQaaRYa SaM>avaiMa YauGae YauGae )) 8 ))\\npariträëäya sädhünäà\\nvinäçäya ca duñkåtäm\\ndharma-saàsthäpanärthäya\\nsambhavämi yuge yuge\\nSYNONYMS\\npariträëäya —for the deliverance; sädhünäm —of the devotees; vinäçäya —for\\nthe annihilation; ca—and; duñkåtäm —of the miscreants; dharma —principles\\nof religion; saàsthäpana-arthäya —to reestablish; sambhavämi —I do appear;\\nyuge—millennium; yuge—after millennium.\\nTRANSLATION\\nTo deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to\\nreestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear, millennium after\\nmillennium.\\nPURPORT\\nAccording to Bhagavad-gétä,  a sädhu  (holy man) is a man in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness. A person may appear to  be irreligious, but if he has theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.qualifications of Kåñëa consciousness wh olly and fully, he is to be understood\\nto be a sädhu.  And duñkåtäm  applies to t hose who do not care for Kåñëa\\nconsciousness. Such miscreants, or duñkåtäm,  are described as foolish and the\\nlowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with mundane\\neducation, whereas a person who is one hundred percent engaged in Kåñëa\\nconscious ness is accepted as a sädhu,  e v e n  t h o u g h  s u c h  a  p e r s o n  m a y  b e\\nneither learned nor well cultured. As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is\\nnot necessary for the Supreme Lord to a ppear as He is to destroy them, as He\\ndid with the demons Rävaëa and Kaàsa.  The Lord has many agents who are\\nquite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord especially descends to\\nappease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demoniac. The\\ndemon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his k in.\\nAlthough Prahläda Mahäräja was the son of Hiraëyakaçipu, he was\\nnonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devaké, the mother of Kåñëa,\\nwas the sister of Kaàsa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only\\nbecause Kåñëa was to be born of them.  So Lord Kåñëa appeared primarily to\\ndeliver Devaké, rather than kill Kaàsa, but both were performed\\nsimultaneously. Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and\\nvanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.\\nIn the Caitanya-caritämåta  of Kåñëadäsa Kaviräja, the following verses\\n(Madhya  20.263–264 ) summarize these principles of incarnation:\\nsåñöi-hetu yei mürti prapaïce avatare\\nsei éçvara-mürti ‘avatära’ näma dhare\\nmäyätéta paravyome sabära avasthäna\\nviçve avatari’ dhare ‘avatära’ näma\\n“The avatära,  or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of\\nGod for material manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality of\\nGodhead who so descends is called an incarnation, or avatära.  Such\\nincarnations are situated in the spiritua l world, the kingdom of God. When\\nthey descend to the material creation, they assume the name avatära. ”\\nThere are various kinds of avatäras,  such as puruñävatäras, guëävatäras,\\nlélävatäras, çakty-äveça avatäras, manvantara-avatäras  and yugävatäras —allCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Lord Çré Kåñëa descends for the specific\\npurpose of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who are very anxious\\nto see Him in His original Våndävana pastimes. Therefore, the prime purpose\\nof the Kåñëa avatära  is to satisfy His unalloyed dev otees.\\nThe Lord says that He incarnates  Himself in every millennium. This\\nindicates that He incarnates also in  the Age of Kali. As stated in the\\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam,  the incarnation in the Age of Kali is Lord Caitanya\\nMahäprabhu, who spread the worship of Kåñëa by the saìkértana  movement\\n(congregational chanting of the holy names) and spread Kåñëa consciousness\\nthroughout India. He predicted that this culture of saìkértana  would be\\nbroadcast all over the world, from town  to town and village to village. Lord\\nCaitanya  as the incarnation of Kåñëa, the Personality of Godhead, is described\\nsecretly but not directly in the confiden tial parts of the revealed scriptures,\\nsuch as the Upaniñads, Mahäbhärata  and Bhägavatam.  The devotees of Lord\\nKåñëa are very much attracted by the saìkértana  movement of Lord Caitanya.\\nThis avatära  of the Lord does not kill the misc reants, but delivers them by His\\ncauseless mercy.\\nTEXT  9\\nJaNMa k-MaR c Mae idVYaMaev& Yaae veita TatvTa\" )\\nTYa¤-a deh& PauNaJaRNMa NaEiTa MaaMaeiTa Saae_JauRNa )) 9 ))\\njanma karma ca me divyam\\nevaà yo vetti tattvataù\\ntyaktvä dehaà punar janma\\nnaiti mäm eti so ’rjuna\\nSYNONYMS\\njanma —birth; karma —work; ca—also; me—of Mine; divyam —transcendental;\\nevam —like this; yaù—anyone who; vetti—knows; tattvataù —in reality;Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

One who can understand the truth of the appearance of the\\nPersonality of Godhead is already liberated from material bondage, and\\ntherefore he returns to the kingdom of God immediately after quitting this\\npresent material body. Such liberation of the living entity from material\\nbondage is not at all easy. The impersonalists and the yogés  attain liberation\\nonly after much trouble and many, many births. Even then, the liber ation they\\nachieve—merging into the impersonal brahmajyoti  of the Lord—is only\\npartial, and there is the risk of returning to this material world. But the\\ndevotee, simply by understanding the tr anscendental nature of the body and\\nactivities of the Lord, at tains the abode of the Lord after ending this body and\\ndoes not run the risk of returning to this material world. In the\\nBrahma-saàhitä  (5.33) it is stated that the Lord has many, many forms and\\nincarnations: advaitam acyutam anädim ananta-rüpam.  Although there are\\nmany transcendental forms of the Lo rd, they are still one and the same\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. One has to understand this fact with\\nconviction, although it is incomprehens ible to mundane scholars and empiric\\nphilosophers. As stated in the  Vedas  (Puruña-bodhiné Upaniñad ):\\neko devo nitya-lélänurakto\\nbhakta-vyäpé hådy antar-ätmä\\n“The one Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally engaged in many,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.many transcendental forms in relationsh ips with His unalloyed devotees.” This\\nVedic version is confirmed in this verse of the Gétä personally by the Lord. He\\nwho accepts this truth on th e strength of the authority of the Vedas  and of the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead and who does not waste time in philosophical\\nspeculations attains the highest perfectional stage of liberation. Simply by\\naccepting this truth on faith, one can, without a d oubt, attain liberation. The\\nVedic version tat tvam asi  is actually applied in this case. Anyone who\\nunderstands Lord Kåñëa to be the Supr eme, or who says unto the Lord “You\\nare the same Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead,” is certainly\\nliberated instantly, and consequently his entrance into the transcendental\\nassociation of the Lord is guaranteed. In  other words, such a faithful devotee of\\nthe Lord attains perfection, and this is confirmed by the following Vedic\\nassertion:\\ntam eva viditväti måtyum eti\\nnänyaù panthä vidyate ’yanäya\\n“One can attain the perfect stage of liberation from birth and death simply\\nby knowing the Lord, the Supreme Pers onality of Godhead, and there is no\\nother way to achieve this perfection.” ( Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  3.8) That there\\nis no alternative means that anyone who does not understand Lord Kåñëa as\\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead is surely in the mode of ignorance and\\nconsequently he will not attain salvatio n simply, so to speak, by licking the\\nouter surface of the bottle of honey, or by interpreting th e Bhagavad-gétä\\naccording to mundane scholarship. Su ch empiric philosophers may assume\\nvery important roles in the material worl d, but they are not necessarily eligible\\nfor liberation. Such puffed-up mundane sc holars have to wait for the causeless\\nmercy of  the devotee of the Lord. One should therefore cultivate Kåñëa\\nconsciousness with faith and knowledge, and in this way attain perfection.\\nTEXT  10\\nvqTaraGa>aYa§-aeDaa MaNMaYaa MaaMauPaaié[Taa\" )Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Such materialists cannot even imagine that\\nthere is a transcendental body which is imperishable, full of knowledge and\\neternally blissful. In the materialistic concept, the body is perishable, full of\\nignorance and completely miserable. Therefore, people in general keep this\\nsame bodily idea in mind when they ar e informed of the personal form of the\\nLord. For such materialistic men, the form of the gigantic material\\nmanifestation is supreme. Consequently they consider the Supreme to be\\nimpersonal. And because they are too materially absorbed, the conception ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.retaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them. When\\nthey are informed that spiritual life is also i ndividual and personal, they\\nbecome afraid of becoming persons again , and so they naturally prefer a kind\\nof merging into the impersonal void . Generally, they compare the living\\nentities to the bubbles of the ocean, which merge into the ocean. That is the\\nhighest perfection of spiritual existence attainable without individual\\npersonality. This is a kind of fearful st age of life, devoid of perfect knowledge\\nof spiritual existence. Furthermore there are many persons who cannot\\nunderstand spiritual existence a t all. Being embarrassed by so many theories\\nand by contradictions of various type s of philosophical speculation, they\\nbecome disgusted or angry and foolishl y conclude that there is no supreme\\ncause and that everything is ultimately void. Such people are i n a diseased\\ncondition of life. Some people are too ma terially attached and therefore do not\\ngive attention to spiritual life, some of them want to merge into the supreme\\nspiritual cause, and some of them disbel ieve in everything, being angry at all\\nsorts of spiritual speculation out of hopelessn ess. This last class of men take to\\nthe shelter of some kind of intoxication, and their affective hallucinations are\\nsometimes accepted as spiritual vision. One has to get rid of all three stages of\\nattachment to th e material world: negligence of spiritual life, fear of a spiritual\\npersonal identity, and the conception of  void that arises from frustration in\\nlife. To get free from these three stages of the material concept of life, one has\\nto take complete shelter of  the Lord, guided by the bo na fide spiritual master,\\nand follow the disciplines and regulative principles of devotional life. The last\\nstage of the devotional life is called bhäva,  or transcendental love of Godhead.\\nAccording to Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  (1.4.15–16 ), the science of devotional\\nservice:\\nädau çraddhä tataù sädhu-\\nsaìgo ’tha bhajana-kriyä\\ntato ’nartha-nivåttiù syät\\ntato niñöhä rucis tataù\\nathäsaktis tato bhävas\\ntataù premäbhyudaïcatiCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is partially\\nrealized in His impersonal brahmajyoti  effulgence and as the all-pervading\\nSupersoul dwelling within everything, includi ng the particles of atoms. But\\nKåñëa is fully realized only by His pure devotees. Consequently, Kåñëa is the\\nobject of everyone’s realization, and thus anyone and everyone is satisfied\\naccording to one’s desire to have Hi m. In the transcendental world also , Kåñëa\\nreciprocates with His pure devotees in the transcendental attitude, just as the\\ndevotee wants Him. One devotee may wa nt Kåñëa as supreme master, another\\nas his personal friend, another as his so n, and still another as his lover. Kåñëa\\nrewards all t he devotees equally, according to their different intensities of love\\nfor Him. In the material world, the same  reciprocations of feelings are there,\\nand they are equally exchanged by th e Lord with the different types of\\nworshipers. The pure devotees both h ere and in the transcendental abode\\nassociate with Him in person and are ab le to render personal service to the\\nLord and thus derive transcendental bli ss in His loving service. As for those\\nwho are impersonalists and who want to commit spiritual suicide by\\nannihilating the individual existence of  the living entity, Kåñëa helps also by\\nabsorbing them into His effulgence. Such  impersonalists do not agree to accept\\nthe eternal, blissful Personality of Go dhead; consequently they cannot relish\\nthe bliss of trans cendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished\\ntheir individuality. Some of them, who are not firmly situated even in the\\nimpersonal existence, return to this material field to exhibit their dormantCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

In other words, everyone is dependent for success upon His mercy\\nalone, and all kinds of spiritual proce sses are but different degrees of success on\\nthe same path.

Actually, the\\ndemigods are not different forms of God, but they are God’s different parts and\\nparcels. God is one, and the parts and parcels are many. The Vedas  say, nityo\\nnityänäm:  God is one. Éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù . The Supreme God is\\none—Kåñëa—and the demigods are delegated with powers to manage thi s\\nmaterial world. These demigods are all living entities ( nityänäm ) with different\\ngrades of material power. They cannot be equal to the Supreme\\nGod—Näräyaëa, Viñëu, or Kåñëa. An yone who thinks that God and the\\ndemigods are on the same level is called an a theist, or päñaëòé.  Even the great\\ndemigods like Brahmä and Çiva cannot be compared to the Supreme Lord. In\\nfact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods such as Brahmä and Çiva\\n(çiva-viriïci-nutam ). Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who\\nare wors hiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of\\nanthropomorphism or zoomorphism. Iha devatäù  denotes a powerful man or\\ndemigod of this material world. But Näräyaëa, Viñëu, or Kåñëa, the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead, does not belong to this world. He i s above, or\\ntranscendental to, material creation. Ev en Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya, the leader of\\nthe impersonalists, maintains that Näräya ëa, or Kåñëa, is beyond this material\\ncreation. However, foolish people ( håta-jïäna ) worship the demigods because\\nthey want immediate results. They get the resu lts, but do not know that results\\nso obtained are temporary and are meant for less intelligent persons. TheCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

In spite of His creating the four\\ndivisions of human society, Lord Kåñëa does not belong to any of these\\ndivisions, b ecause He is not one of the conditioned souls, a section of whom\\nform human society. Human society is si milar to any other animal society, but\\nto elevate men from the animal stat us, the above-mentioned divisions are\\ncreated by the Lord for the systematic d evelopment of Kåñëa consciousness.\\nThe tendency of a particular man toward  work is determined by the modes of\\nmaterial nature which he has acquired. Such symptoms of life, according to the\\ndifferent modes of material nature, are described in the Eighteenth  Chapter of\\nthis book. A person in Kåñëa consci ousness, however, is above even the\\nbrähmaëas.  Although brähmaëas  by quality are supposed to know about\\nBrahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth,  most of them approach only the\\nimpersonal Brahman manifestation of L ord Kåñëa.

Kåñëa consciousness includes\\nknowledge of all different plenary ex pansions of Kåñëa, namely Räma,\\nNåsiàha, Varäha, etc. And as Kåñëa is transcendental to this system of the\\nfour divisions of human society, a pe rson in Kåñëa consciousness is also\\ntranscendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the\\ndivisions of community, nation or species.\\nTEXT  14\\nNa Maa& k-MaaRi<a il/MPaiNTa Na Mae k-MaRf-le/ SPa*ha )\\nwiTa Maa& Yaae_i>aJaaNaaiTa k-MaRi>aNaR Sa bDYaTae )) 14 ))\\nna mäà karmäëi limpanti\\nna me karma-phale spåhä\\niti mäà yo ’bhijänäti\\nkarmabhir na sa badhyate\\nSYNONYMS\\nna—never; mäm —Me; karmäëi —all kinds of work; limpanti —do affect;\\nna—nor; me—My; karma-phale —in fruitive action; spåhä —aspiration;\\niti—thus; mäm —Me; yaù—one who; abhijänäti —does know; karmabhiù —by\\nthe reaction of such work; na—never; saù—he; badhyate —become s entangled.\\nTRANSLATION\\nThere is no work that affects Me; nor do I aspire for the fruits of action.\\nOne who understands this truth about Me also does not become entangled in\\nthe fruitive reactions of work.\\nPURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The Lord,\\nbeing full in Himself, has no attraction for so-called heavenly happiness. The\\nheavenly demigods ar e only His engaged servants.

All Rights Reserved.PURPORT\\nHow activities in Kåñëa consciousne ss can lead one ultimately to the\\nspiritual goal is described here. There are various activities in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness, and all of them will be described in the following verses. But,\\nfor the present, just the principle of Kåñëa consciousness is described. A\\nconditioned soul, entangled in material contamination, is sure to act in the\\nmaterial atmosphere, and yet he has to get out of such an environment. The\\nprocess by which the conditioned soul can get out of the material  atmosphere\\nis Kåñëa consciousness. For example, a patient who is suffering from a disorder\\nof the bowels due to overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk\\nproduct, namely curds. The materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured\\nby Kåñëa consciousness as set forth here in the Gétä.  This process is generally\\nknown as yajïa,  or activities (sacrifices) simp ly meant for the satisfaction of\\nViñëu, or Kåñëa. The more the activities of the material world are performed\\nin Kåñëa consciousness, or f or Viñëu only, the more the atmosphere becomes\\nspiritualized by complete absorption. The word brahma  (Brahman) means\\n“spiritual.” The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are\\ncalled brahmajyoti,  His spiritual effulgence. Everything th at exists is situated in\\nthat brahmajyoti,  but when the jyoti i s  c o v e r e d  b y  i l l u s i o n  ( mäyä ) or sense\\ngratification, it is called material. This material veil can be removed at once by\\nKåñëa consciousness; thus the offering for the sake of Kåñëa consciousne ss, the\\nconsuming agent of such an offeri ng or contribution, the process of\\nconsumption, the contributor, an d the result are—all combined\\ntogether—Brahman, or the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth covered by\\nmäyä  is called matter. Matter dovetailed for th e cause of the Absolute Truth\\nregains its spiritual quality. Kåñëa consciousness is the process of converting\\nthe illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme. When the mind is\\nfully absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness, it is said to be in samädhi,  or t rance.\\nAnything done in such transcendental consciousness is called yajïa,  or\\nsacrifice for the Absolute.

All the\\ndifferent varieties of sacrifice can be  placed within two primary divisions:\\nnamely, sacrifice of worldly possessions and sacrifice in pursuit of\\ntranscendental knowledge. Those who are in Kåñëa consciousness sacrifice all\\nmaterial possessions for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, while others,\\nwho want some temporary material happiness, sacrifice their material\\npossessions to satisfy demigods s uch as Indra, the sun-god, etc. And others, who\\nare impersonalists, sacrifice their iden tity by merging into the existence of\\nimpersonal Brahman. The demigods are powerful living entities appointed by\\nthe Supreme Lord for the maintenance and supervision of  all material\\nfunctions like the heating, watering an d lighting of the universe. Those who\\nare interested in material benefits wo rship the demigods by various sacrifices\\naccording to the Vedic rituals. They are called bahv-éçvara-vädé,  or believers in\\nmany  gods. But others, who worship the impersonal feature of the Absolute\\nTruth and regard the forms of the demi gods as temporary, sacrifice their\\nindividual selves in the supreme fire and thus end their individual existences\\nby merging into the existence of t he Supreme. Such impersonalists sacrifice\\ntheir time in philosophical speculation to understand the transcendental\\nnature of the Supreme. In other words,  the fruitive workers sacrifice their\\nmaterial possessions for material enjoyment, whereas the imperson alist\\nsacrifices his material designations with  a view to merging into the existence\\nof the Supreme. For the impersonalist, th e fire altar of sacrifice is the Supreme\\nBrahman, and the offering is the self being consumed by the fire of Brahman.\\nThe Kåñëa co nscious person, like Arjuna, however, sacrifices everything for\\nthe satisfaction of Kåñëa, and thus a ll his material possessions as well as his\\nown self—everything—is sacrificed for Kåñëa. Thus, he is the first-class yogé;\\nbut he does not lose his individu al existence.\\nTEXT  26\\né[ae}aadqNaqiNd]Yaa<YaNYae Sa&YaMaaiGanzu JauûiTa )\\nXaBdadqiNvzYaaNaNYa wiNd]YaaiGanzu JauûiTa )) 26 ))Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The brahmacärés,  or\\nstudents under the care of a bona fide  spiritual master, control the mind by\\nabstaining from sense gratification. A brahmacäré  hears only words concerning\\nKåñëa consciousness; hearing is the basic principle for understanding, and\\ntherefore the pure brahmacäré  engages fully in harer\\nnämänukértanam —chanting and hearing the glorie s of the Lord.

As long\\nas the soul is attached to sense enjoyment it is called paräg-ätmä,  but as soon as\\nthe same soul becomes d etached from such sense enjoyment it is called\\npratyag-ätmä.  The soul is subjected to the func tions of ten kinds of air at work\\nwithin the body, and this is percei ved through the breathing system. The\\nPataïjali system of yoga instructs one on how to contro l the functions of the\\nbody’s air in a technical manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air\\nwithin become favorable for purifying the soul of material attachment.\\nAccording to this yoga system, pratyag-ätmä  is the ultimate goal. This\\npratyag-ät mä is withdrawn from activities in matter. The senses interact with\\nthe sense objects, like the ear for hearin g, eyes for seeing, nose for smelling,\\ntongue for tasting, hand for touching , and all of them are thus engaged in\\nactivities outside the self. The y are called the functions of the präëa-väyu.  The\\napäna-väyu  goes downwards, vyäna-väyu  acts to shrink and expand,\\nsamäna-väyu  adjusts equilibrium, udäna-väyu  goes upwards—and when one is\\nenlightened, one engages all these in searching for self-realization .\\nTEXT  28\\nd]VYaYajaSTaPaaeYaja YaaeGaYajaSTaQaaPare )\\nSvaDYaaYajaNaYajaê YaTaYa\" Sa&iXaTav]Taa\" )) 28 ))\\ndravya-yajïäs tapo-yajïä\\nyoga-yajïäs tathäpare\\nsvädhyäya-jïäna-yajïäç ca\\nyatayaù saàçita-vratäù\\nSYNONYMS\\ndravya-yajïäù —sacrificing one’s possessions; tapaù-yajïäù —sacrifice in\\nausterities; yoga-yajïäù —sacrifice in eightfold mysticism; tathä —thus;\\napare —others; svädhyäya —sacrifice in the study of the Vedas;Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

In other countries, too, there are many hospitals, old age\\nhomes and similar charitable foundations meant for distributing food,\\neducation and medical treatment free to the poor. Al l these charitable\\nactivities are called dravyamaya-yajïa.  There are others who, for higher\\nelevation in life or for promotion to higher planets within the universe,\\nvoluntarily accept many kinds of austerities such as candräyaëa  and\\ncäturmäsya.  These proc esses entail severe vows for conducting life under\\ncertain rigid rules. For example, under the cäturmäsya  vow the candidate does\\nnot shave for four months during the ye ar (July to October), he does not eat\\ncertain foods, does not eat twice in a day or does  not leave home. Such\\nsacrifice of the comforts of life is called tapomaya-yajïa.  There are still others\\nwho engage themselves in different kinds of mystic yogas  like the Pataïjali\\nsystem (for merging into the existence of the Absolute), or haöha-yoga  or\\nañöäìga-yoga  (for particular perfections). And some travel to all the sanctified\\nplaces of pilgrimage. All these practices are called yoga-yajïa,  sacrifice for a\\ncertain type of perfection in the mate rial world.

This\\npractice involves controlling the airs wi thin the body so as to reverse the\\ndirections of their passage. The apäna  air goes downward, and the präëa  air\\ngoes up.

A Kåñëa conscious person, however, being always\\nsituated in the transcendental lovi ng service of the Lord, automatically\\nbecomes the controller of the senses. Hi s senses, being always engaged in the\\nservice of Kåñëa, have no chance of becoming otherw ise engaged. So at the\\nend of life, he is naturally transferre d to the transcendental plane of Lord\\nKåñëa; consequently he makes no attempt to increase his longevity.

In other words, existe nce in the material world is due to the\\nmultiple reactions to our sinful lives. Ig norance is the cause of sinful life, and\\nsinful life is  the cause of one’s dragging on in material existence. The human\\nform of life is the only loophole  by which one may get out of this\\nentanglement. The Vedas,  therefore, give us a chance for escape by pointing\\nout the paths of religion, economic comfort, reg ulated sense gratification and,\\nat last, the means to get out of the miserable condition entirely. The path of\\nreligion, or the different kinds of sacrifice recommended above, automatically\\nsolves our economic problems. By performance of yajïa  we can have enough\\nfood, enough milk, etc.—even if there is  a so-called increase of population.\\nWhen the body is fully supplied, naturally the next stage is to satisfy the\\nsenses. The Vedas  prescribe, therefore, sacred marriage for regulated sense\\ngratification. There by one is gradually elevated to the platform of release from\\nmaterial bondage, and the highest perfecti on of liberated life is to associate\\nwith the Supreme Lord. Perfection is achieved by performance of yajïa\\n(sacrifice), as described above. Now, if a per son is not inclined to perform\\nyajïa  according to the Vedas,  how can he expect a happy life even in this body,\\nand what to speak of another body on another planet? There are different\\ngrades of material comforts in diffe rent heavenly planets, and in all ca ses there\\nis immense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds of yajïa.  But the\\nhighest kind of happiness that a man ca n achieve is to be promoted to the\\nspiritual planets by practice of Kåñëa consciousness.

Some think\\nthat we have nothing to do with Kåñëa,  that Kåñëa is only a great historical\\npersonality and that the Absolute is the impersonal Brahman. Factually, as it is\\nstated in the Bhagavad-gétä,  this impersonal Brahman is the personal\\neffulgence of Kåñëa. Kåñëa, as the Su preme Personality of Godhead, is the\\ncause of everything. In the Brahma-saàhitä  it is clearly stated that Kåñëa is the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, the ca use of all causes. Even the millions of\\nincarn ations are only His different expans ions. Similarly, the living entities\\nare also expansions of Kåñëa. The Mäyävädé philosophers wrongly think that\\nKåñëa loses His own separate existence in His many expansions. This thought\\nis material in nature. We have e xperience in the material world that a thing,\\nwhen fragmentally distributed, lose s its own original identity.

By mäyä  alone Arjuna thought that the\\ntemporary bodily relationship with his kinsmen was more important than his\\neternal spiritual relationship with Kåñëa. The whole tea ching of the Gétä is\\ntargeted toward this end: that a livi ng being, as Kåñëa’s eternal servitor,\\ncannot be separated from Kåñëa, and his sense of being an identity apart from\\nKåñëa is called mäyä.  The living entities, as separate parts and parcels of the\\nSupreme, have a purpose to fulfill. Ha ving forgotten that purpose since time\\nimmemorial, they are situated in different bodies, as men, animals, demigods,\\netc. Such bodily differences arise fr om forgetfulness of the transcendental\\nservice of the Lord. But w hen one is engaged in transcendental service\\nthrough Kåñëa consciousness, one becomes at once liberated from this illusion.\\nOne can acquire such pure knowledge only from the bona fide spiritual master\\nand thereby avoid the delusion  that the living entity i s equal to Kåñëa. Perfect\\nknowledge is that the Supreme Soul, Kåñëa, is the supreme shelter for all living\\nentities, and giving up such shelter, th e living entities are deluded by the\\nmaterial energy, imagining themselves to have a separate identity. Thus,  under\\ndifferent standards of material identi ty, they become forgetful of Kåñëa.\\nWhen, however, such deluded living en tities become situated in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness, it is to be understood th at they are on the path of liberation, as\\nconfirmed in the Bhägava tam (2.10.6 ): muktir hitvänyathä-rüpaà svarüpeëa\\nvyavasthitiù.

All Rights Reserved.The yoga system instructed in this chapter is called sanätana-yoga,  or\\neternal activities performed by the living entity. This yoga has two divisions of\\nsacrificial actions: one is called sacrifice of one’s material possessions, and the\\nother is called kno wledge of self, which is pure spiritual activity. If sacrifice of\\none’s material possessions is not dovetail ed for spiritual realization, then such\\nsacrifice becomes material. But one who performs such sacrifices with a\\nspiritual objective, or in devotiona l service, makes a perfect sacrifice. When we\\ncome to spiritual activities, we find that these are also divided into two:\\nnamely, understanding of one’s own self (or one’s constitutional position), and\\nthe truth regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead . One who follows the\\npath of Bhagavad-gétä  as it is can very easily understand these two important\\ndivisions of spiritual knowledge. For him there is no difficulty in obtaining\\nperfect knowledge of the self as pa rt and parcel of the Lord. And such\\nunderst anding is beneficial, for such a person can easily understand the\\ntranscendental activities of the Lord. In the beginning of this chapter, the\\ntranscendental activities of the Lord were discussed by the Supreme Lord\\nHimself. One who does not understand the  instructions of the Gétä is faithless,\\nand is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence awarded\\nto him by the Lord. In spite of such instructions, one who does not understand\\nthe real nature of the Lord as  the eternal, blissful, all-know ing Personality of\\nGodhead is certainly fool number one.  Ignorance can be removed by gradual\\nacceptance of the principles of Kåñë a consciousness. Kåñëa consciousness is\\nawakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods, sacrifice to\\nBrahman, sacrif ice in celibacy, in household life, in controlling the senses, in\\npracticing mystic yoga,  in penance, in forgoing material possessions, in\\nstudying the Vedas,  and in partaking of the social institution called\\nvarëäçrama-dharma.  All of these are known as sa crifice, and all of them are\\nbased on regulated action. But within a ll these activities, the important factor\\nis self-realization. One who seeks that objective is the real student of\\nBhagavad-gétä,  but one who doubts the author ity of Kåñëa falls back. One is\\ntherefore advised to study Bhagavad-gétä,  or any other scripture, under a bona\\nfide spiritual master, with service and su rrender. A bona fide spiritual master is\\nin the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does not deviate at allCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.from the inst ructions of the Supreme Lord as  they were imparted millions of\\nyears ago to the sun-god, from  whom the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä  have\\ncome down to the earthly kingdom. On e should, therefore, follow the path of\\nBhagavad-gétä  as it is expressed in the Gétä itself and beware of self-interested\\npeople after personal aggrandizement wh o deviate others from the actual path.\\nThe Lord is definitely the supreme person, and His activities are\\ntranscendental.

How to get out of this\\nmaterial encagement by buddhi-yoga,  or devotional service, was also explained\\ntherein. In the Third Chap ter, it was explained that a person who is situated\\non the platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform.

All Rights Reserved.Fruitive activities (seeking sense gratification) are cause for material\\nbondage. As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the\\nstandard of bodily comfort, one is sure  to transmigrate to different types of\\nbodies, thereby continuing materi al bondage perpetually. Çrémad-Bhägavatam\\n(5.5.4–6 ) confirms this as follows:\\nnünaà pramattaù kurute vikarma\\nyad indriya-prétaya äpåëoti\\nna sädhu manye yata ätmano ’yam\\nasann api kleça-da äsa dehaù\\nparäbhavas tävad abodha-jäto\\nyävan na jijïäsata ätma-tattvam\\nyävat kriyäs tävad idaà mano vai\\nkarmätmakaà yena çaréra-bandhaù\\nevaà manaù karma-vaçaà prayuìkte\\navidyayätmany upadhéyamäne\\nprétir na yävan mayi väsudeve\\nna mucyate deha-yogena tävat\\n“People are mad after sense gratification, and they do not know that this\\npresent body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one’s fruitive activities in\\nthe past. Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one trouble in\\nmany ways. Therefor e, to act for sense gratification is not good. One is\\nconsidered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about his real\\nidentity. As long as he does not know his real identity, he has to work for\\nfruitive results for sense gratification, and  as long as one is engrossed in the\\nconsciousness of sense gratification one has to transmigrate from one body to\\nanother. Although the mind may be en grossed in fruitive activities and\\ninfluenced by ignorance, one must de velop a love for devotional service  to\\nVäsudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage\\nof material existence.”\\nTherefore, jïäna  (or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit\\nsoul) is not sufficient for liberation. One has to act in the status of spirit soul,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.otherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness is not, howe ver, action on the fruitive platform. Activities\\nperformed in full knowledge strengthen one’s advancement in real knowledge.\\nWithout Kåñëa consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not\\nactually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long as the heart is not\\npurified, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But action in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness automatically helps one esca pe the result of fruitive action so\\nthat one need not descend to the mater ial platform. Therefore action in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk of\\nfalling. Renunciation without Kåñëa consciousness is incomplete, as is\\nconfirmed by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé in his Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  (1.2.258 ):\\npräpaïcikatayä buddhyä\\nhari-sambandhi-vastunaù\\nmumukñubhiù parityägo\\nvairägyaà phalgu kathyate\\n“When persons eager to achieve liberation renounce things related to the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, thinking them to be material, their\\nrenunciation is called incomplete.” Renunc iation is complete when it is in the\\nknowledge that everything in existen ce belongs to the Lord and that no one\\nshould claim proprietorship over an ything. One should understand that,\\nfactually, nothing belongs to anyone . Then where is the question of\\nrenunciation? One who knows that everyt hing is Kåñëa’s property is always\\nsituated in renunciation. Since everything  belongs to Kåñëa, everything should\\nbe employed in the service of Kåñëa.

The\\nMäyävädé sannyäsés  also study the Vedänta-sütras,  but use their own\\ncommentary, called Çäréraka-bhäñya,  written by Çaìkaräcärya. The students of\\nthe Bhägavata  school are engaged in the devotional service of the Lord,\\naccording to päïcarätriké  regulations, and therefore the Vaiñëava sannyäsés\\nhave multiple engagements in the tran scendental service of the Lord. The\\nVaiñëava sannyäsés  have nothing to do with material activities, and yet they\\nperform various activities in their devotional service to the Lord. But the\\nMäyävädé sannyäsés,  engaged in the studies of Säìkhya and Vedänta and\\nspeculation, cannot relish the transcen dental service of the Lord. Because\\ntheir studies become very tedious, they sometimes become tired of  Brahman\\nspeculation, and thus they take shelter of the Bhägavatam  without proper\\nunderstanding. Consequently their study of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  becomes\\ntroublesome. Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial\\nmeans are all useless for the Mäyävädé sannyäsés.  The Vaiñëava sannyäsés,  who\\nare engaged in devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their\\ntranscendental duties, and they have th e guarantee of ultimate entrance into\\nthe kingdom of God. The Mäyävädé sannyäsés  sometimes fal l down from the\\npath of self-realization and again en ter into material activities of a\\nphilanthropic and altruistic natu re, which are nothing but material\\nengagements. Therefore, the conclusi on is that those who are engaged in\\nKåñëa conscious activities ar e better situated than the sannyäsés  engaged in\\nsimple speculation about what is Brah man and what is not Brahman, although\\nthey too come to Kåñëa consciousness, after many births.\\nTEXT  7Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

This is due to his\\nKåñëa consciousness. Such a person cannot think of any living being as\\nseparate from Kåñëa, just as th e leaves and branches of a tree are not separate\\nfrom the tree.

Because his mind is  always fixed on Kåñëa, there is no\\nchance of his being deviated from Kåñë a. Nor is there a chance that he will\\nengage his senses in matters other tha n the service of the Lord. He does not\\nlike to hear anything except topics relating to Kåñëa; he does not like to eat\\nanything which is not offered to Kåñëa; and he does not wish to go anywhere if\\nKåñëa is not involved. Therefore, his senses are controlled . A man of\\ncontrolled senses cannot be offensive to  anyone. One may ask, “Why then was\\nArjuna offensive (in battle) to others ? Wasn’t he in Kåñëa consciousness?”\\nArjuna was only superficially offensive because (as has already been explained\\nin the Second C hapter) all the assembled persons on the battlefield would\\ncontinue to live individually, as the soul cannot be slain. So, spiritually, no one\\nwas killed on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra. Only their dresses were changed by\\nthe order of Kåñëa, who was perso nally present. Therefore Arjuna, while\\nfighting on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, was not really fighting at all; he was\\nsimply carrying out the orders of Kåñëa in full Kåñëa consciousness.

The activities of the body,\\nor the figurative city of body, are co nducted automatically by its particular\\nmodes of nature. The soul, although subjec ting himself to the conditions of the\\nbody, can be beyond  those conditions, if he so desires. Owing only to\\nforgetfulness of his superior nature, he identifies with the material body, and\\ntherefore suffers. By Kåñëa consciousness,  he can revive his real position and\\nthus come out of his embodiment. Therefore, wh en one takes to Kåñëa\\nconsciousness, one at once becomes comp letely aloof from bodily activities. In\\nsuch a controlled life, in which his deliberations are changed, he lives happily\\nwithin the city of nine gates.

He is always\\nsatisfied in Himself, undisturbed by sinful or pious activities. He does not\\ncreate a particular situation for any living entity, but the living entity,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.bewildered by ignorance, desires to be put into certain conditions of life, and\\nthereby his chain of action and reaction begins. A living entity is, by superior\\nnature, full of knowledge. Nevertheless, he is prone to be influenced by\\nignorance due to his limited power. The Lord is omnipotent, but the living\\nentity is not. The Lord is vibhu,  or omniscient, but the living entity is aëu, or\\natomic. Because he is a living soul, he has the capacity to desire by his free will.\\nSuch desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent Lord. And so, when the living\\nentity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill those desires,\\nbut the Lord is never responsible for th e actions and reactions of the particular\\nsituati on which may be desired. Being in a bewildered condition, therefore, the\\nembodied soul identifies himself with the circumstantial material body and\\nbecomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life. The Lord is\\nthe constant companion of the l iving entity as Paramätmä, or the Supersoul,\\nand therefore He can understand the desi res of the individual soul, as one can\\nsmell the flavor of a flower by being near it. Desire is a subtle form of\\nconditioning for the living en tity. The Lord fulfills his desire as he deserves:\\nMan proposes and God disposes. The individual is not, therefore, omnipotent\\nin fulfilling his desires. The Lord, howe ver, can fulfill all desires, and the Lord,\\nbeing neutral to everyone, does not interfere with the desires of the mi nute\\nindependent living entities. However, wh en one desires Kåñëa, the Lord takes\\nspecial care and encourages one to desire  in such a way that one can attain to\\nHim and be eternally happy. The Vedic hymns therefore declare, eña u hy eva\\nsädhu karma kärayat i taà yam ebhyo lokebhya unninéñate.  eña u eväsädhu karma\\nkärayati yam adho ninéñate:  “The Lord engages the living entity in pious\\nactivities so that he may be elevat ed.

It is stated in the\\nBhagavad-gétä,  sarvaà jïäna-plavena,  jïänägniù sarva-karmäëi  and na hi\\njïänena sadåçam.  Knowledge is always  highly esteemed. And what is that\\nknowledge? Perfect knowledge is achiev ed when one surrenders unto Kåñëa, as\\nis said in the Seventh Chapter, 19th verse : bahünäà janmanäm ante jïänavän\\nmäà prapadyate.  After passing through many, many births, when one perf ect\\nin knowledge surrenders unto Kåñëa, or when one attains Kåñëa consciousness,\\nthen everything is revealed to him, as everything is revealed by the sun in the\\ndaytime. The living entity is bewilder ed in so many ways. For instance, when\\nhe unceremoniously  thinks himself God, he actua lly falls into the last snare of\\nnescience. If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by\\nnescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience,\\nor Satan, is greater than God. Real knowledg e can be obtained from a person\\nwho is in perfect Kåñëa consciousness. Therefore, one has to seek out such a\\nbona fide spiritual master and, under him, learn what Kåñëa consciousness is,\\nfor Kåñëa consciousness will certainly  drive away all nescience, as t he sun\\ndrives away darkness. Even though a pe rson may be in full knowledge that he\\nis not this body but is transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to\\ndiscriminate between the soul and the Supersoul. However, he can know\\neverything well if he c ares to take shelter of the perfect, bona fide Kåñëa\\nconscious spiritual master. One can kn ow God and one’s relationship with\\nGod only when one actually meets a re presentative of God. A representative\\nof God never claims that he is God, although he is paid  all the respect\\nordinarily paid to God because he has knowledge of God. One has to learn the\\ndistinction between God and the living entity. Lord Çré Kåñëa therefore stated\\nin the Second Chapter ( 2.12) that every living being is individual and that the\\nLord also is individual. They were a ll individuals in the past, they are\\nindividuals at present, and they will cont inue to be individuals in the future,\\neven after liberation.

The brähmaëa  and the outcaste may be different from the social point\\nof view, or a dog, a cow, and an elep hant may be different from the point of\\nview of species, but these d ifferences of body are meaningless from the\\nviewpoint of a learned transcendentalist.  This is due to their relationship to\\nthe Supreme, for the Supreme Lord, by His plenary portion as Paramätmä, is\\npresent in everyone’s heart. Such an understanding of the Supreme is real\\nknowledge. As far as the bodies are co ncerned in different castes or different\\nspecies of life, the Lord is equally kind to everyone because He treats every\\nliving being as a friend yet maintains Himself as Paramätmä regardless of the\\ncircu mstances of the living entities. The Lord as Paramätmä is present both in\\nthe outcaste and in the brähmaëa,  although the body of a brähmaëa  and that\\nof an outcaste are not the same. Th e bodies are material productions of\\ndifferent modes of material nature,  but the soul and the Supersoul within the\\nbody are of the same spiritual quality. The similarity in the quality of the soul\\nand the Supersoul, however, does not ma ke them equal in quantity, for the\\nindividual soul is present only in that particular body w hereas the Paramätmä\\nis present in each and every body . A Kåñëa conscious person has full\\nknowledge of this, and therefore he is truly learned and has equal vision. The\\nsimilar characteristics of the soul and Supersoul are that they are both\\nconscious, ete rnal and blissful. But the difference is that the individual soul is\\nconscious within the limited jurisdiction  of the body whereas the Supersoul is\\nconscious of all bodies.

When one is well situated in devotional service,\\none comes to the transcendental pos ition, qualified to feel the presence of the\\nLord in the sphere of one’s activity. This  particular position is called liberation\\nin the Supreme.\\nAfter explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the\\nLord gives instruction to Arjuna as to  how one can come to that position by\\nthe practice of the mysticism or yoga known as añöäìga-yoga,  which is divisible\\ninto an eightfold procedure called yama, niyama, äsana, präëäyäma,\\npratyähära, dhäraëä, dhyäna  and samädhi.  In the Sixth Chapter the subject of\\nyoga is explicitly detailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only preliminarily\\nexplained. One has to drive out the sense objects such as sound, touch, form,\\ntaste and smell by the pratyähära  process in yoga,  and then keep the vision of\\nthe eyes between the two eyebrows an d concentrate on the tip of the nose\\nwith half-closed lids. There is no benefi t in closing the eyes altogether, because\\nthen there is every chance of falling asleep. Nor is there benefit in opening theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.eyes completely, because then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense\\nobjects. The breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by\\nneutralizing the up-moving a nd down-moving air within the body. By practice\\nof such yoga one is able to gain control over  the senses, refrain from outward\\nsense objects, and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme.\\nThis yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger\\nand thus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation. In\\nother words, Kåñëa consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga\\nprinciples. This will be thor oughly explained in the next chapter. A Kåñëa\\nconscious person, however, being always engaged in devotional service, does\\nnot risk losing his senses to some other engagement. This is a better way of\\ncontrolling the senses than by the añöäìga-yoga.\\nTEXT  29\\n>aae¢-ar& YajTaPaSaa& SavRl/aek-MaheìrMa( )\\nSauôd& SavR>aUTaaNaa& jaTva Maa& XaaiNTaMa*C^iTa )) 29 ))\\nbhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäà\\nsarva-loka-maheçvaram\\nsuhådaà sarva-bhütänäà\\njïätvä mäà çäntim åcchati\\nSYNONYMS\\nbhoktäram —the beneficiary; yajïa —of sacrifices; tapasäm —and penances and\\nausterities; sarva-loka —of all planets and the demigods thereof;\\nmahä-éçvaram —the Supreme Lord; su-hådam —the benefactor; sarva —of all;\\nbhütänäm —the living entities; jïätvä —thus knowin g; mäm —Me (Lord\\nKåñëa); çäntim —relief from material pangs; åcchati —one achieves.\\nTRANSLATION\\nA person in full consciousness of Me, knowing Me to be the ultimateCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

But they do not know the formula for\\npeace, which is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-gétä.  The greatest peace\\nformula is simply this:  Lord Kåñëa is the beneficiary in all human activities.\\nMen should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because\\nHe is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater\\nthan He. He is greater than the greatest o f the demigods, Lord Çiva and Lord\\nBrahmä. In the Vedas  (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  6.7) the Supreme Lord is\\ndescribed as tam éçvaräëäà paramaà maheçvaraà.  Under the spell of illusion,\\nliving entities are trying to be lord s of all they survey, but actually they  are\\ndominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of\\nmaterial nature, and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of\\nmaterial nature. Unless one understands th ese bare facts, it is not possible to\\nachieve peace in the wo rld either individually or collectively. This is the sense\\nof Kåñëa consciousness: Lord Kåñëa is the supreme predominator, and all living\\nentities, including the great demigods , are His subordinates. One can attain\\nperfect peace only in complete Kåñëa cons ciousness.\\nThis Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of Kåñëa consciousness,\\ngenerally known as karma-yoga.  The question of mental speculation as to how\\nkarma-yoga  can give liberation is answered herewith. To work in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness is to work with the comple te knowledge of the Lord as the\\npredominator. Such work is not diffe rent from transcendental knowledge.\\nDirect Kåñëa consciousness is bhakti-yoga,  and jïäna-yoga  is a path leading to\\nbhakti-yoga.  Kåñëa consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one’s\\nrelationship with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this\\nconsciousness is full knowledge of Kå ñëa, or the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead. A pure soul is the eternal serv ant of God as His fragmental part andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.parcel. He comes into contact with mäyä (illusion) due to the desire to lord it\\nover mäyä,  and that is the cause of his many  sufferings. As long as he is in\\ncontact with matter, he has to execute wo rk in terms of material necessities.\\nKåñëa consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual lif e even while one is\\nwithin the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by\\npractice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is freed\\nfrom the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everyt hing\\ndepends on one’s practical performance of duties in Kåñëa consciousness,\\nwhich helps one control the senses in every respect and conquer the influence\\nof desire and anger. And one who stands fast in Kåñëa consciousness,\\ncontrolling the abovementioned passions, remains factually in the\\ntranscendental stage, or brahma-nirväëa.  The eightfold yoga mysticism is\\nautomatically practiced in Kåñëa consciousness because the ultimate purpose is\\nserved. There is a gradual process of elevation in the practice of yama, niyama,\\näsana, präëäyäma, pratyähära, dhäraëä, dhyäna  and samädhi.  But these only\\npreface perfection by devotional servic e, which alone can award peace to the\\nhuman being. It is the highest perfection of life.\\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifth Chapter of the Çrémad\\nBhagavad-gétä  in the matter of Karma-yoga,  or Action in Kåñëa Consciousness.\\n- CHAPTER 6 -\\nDhyäna-yoga\\nTEXT  1\\né[q>aGavaNauvacCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

However, this is very\\ndifficult for people in general to perf orm, especially in the Age of Kali.\\nAlthough the eightfold yoga system is recommended in this chapter, the Lord\\nemphasizes that the process of karma-yoga,  or acting in Kåñëa consciousness, is\\nbetter. Everyone acts in this world to maintain his family and their\\nparaphernalia, but no one is working without some self-interest , some personal\\ngratification, be it concentrated or ex tended. The criterion of perfection is to\\nact in Kåñëa consciousness, and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.To act in Kåñëa consciousness is the duty  of every living entity because all ar e\\nconstitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme. The parts of the body work\\nfor the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of the body do not act for\\nself-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the\\nliving entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for\\npersonal satisfaction is the perfect sannyäsé,  the perfect yogi.\\nThe sannyäsés  sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated\\nfrom all material duties, and therefore they cease to perform agnihotra yajïas\\n(fire sacrifices), but actually they are self-interested because their goal is to\\nbecome one with the impersonal Brahman. Such a desire is greater than any\\nmaterial desire, but it is not without self-interest. Similarly, the mystic yogé\\nwho practices the yoga system with half-open eyes, ceasing all material\\nactivities, desires some satisfaction for his per sonal self. But a person acting in\\nKåñëa consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole, without\\nself-interest. A Kåñëa conscious person has no desire for self-satisfaction. His\\ncriterion of success is the satisfaction of Kåñëa, and thus he is the p erfect\\nsannyäsé,  or perfect yogé. Lord Caitanya, the highest perfectional symbol of\\nrenunciation, prays in this way:\\nna dhanaà na janaà na sundaréà\\nkavitäà vä jagad-éça kämaye\\nmama janmani janmanéçvare\\nbhavatäd bhaktir ahaituké tvayi\\n“O Almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor to enjoy\\nbeautiful women.

The living entity has no\\nseparate independent identity. He is the marginal energy of the Supreme.\\nWhen he is entrapped by materia l energy, he is conditioned, and when he is\\nKåñëa conscious, or aware of the spiritua l energy, then he is in his real and\\nnatural state of life. Therefore, when on e is in complete knowledge, one ceases\\nall material sense gratification, or renounces all kin ds of sense gratificatory\\nactivities. This is practiced by the yogés  who restrain the senses from material\\nattachment. But a person in Kåñëa consciousness has no opportunity to engage\\nhis senses in anything which is not for the purpose of Kåñëa. Therefore,  a\\nKåñëa conscious person is simultaneously a sannyäsé  and a yogé. The purpose of\\nknowledge and of restraining the senses, as prescribed in the jïäna  and yoga\\nprocesses, is automatically served in Kåñëa consciousness. If one is unable to\\ngive up the activi ties of his selfish nature, then jïäna  and yoga are of no avail.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.The real aim is for a living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction and to be\\nprepared to satisfy the Supreme. A Kåñë a conscious person has no desire for\\nany kind of self-enjoyment. He is  always engaged for the enjoyment of the\\nSupreme. One who has no informatio n of the Supreme must therefore be\\nengaged in self-satisfaction, because no one can stand on the platform of\\ninactivity.

According to various\\nelevations, different parts of the ladder are known by different names.

All such activities lead to achieving perfect mental\\nequilibrium to control the senses. When one is accomplished in the practice of\\nmeditation, he ceases all disturbing mental activities.\\nA Kåñëa conscious person, however, is situated from the beginning on the\\nplatform of meditation because he a lways thinks of Kåñëa.

In the yoga system, the mind and the conditioned soul are\\nespecially important. Since the mind is the central point of yoga practice, ätmä\\nrefers here to the mind. The purpos e of the yoga system is to control the mind\\nand to draw it away from attachment to sense objects. It is stressed herein that\\nthe mind must be so trained that it ca n deliver the conditioned soul from the\\nmire of nescience. In material existence one is subje cted to the influence of\\nthe mind and the senses. In fact, the pu re soul is entangled in the material\\nworld because the mind is involved with the false ego, which desires to lord it\\nover material nature. Therefore, the mind should be trained so that it wil l not\\nbe attracted by the glitter of material nature, and in this way the conditioned\\nsoul may be saved. One should not de grade oneself by attraction to sense\\nobjects. The more one is attracted by sense objects, the more one becomes\\nentangled in material e xistence.

Kåñëa consciousness means, concisely, to be\\nalways engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. But those\\nwho are attached to the impersonal B rahman or the localized Supersoul are\\nalso partially Kåñëa conscious, because impersonal Brahman is the spiritual ray\\nof Kåñëa and Supersoul is the all-perv ading partial expansion of Kåñëa. Thus\\nthe impersonalist and the meditator are also indirectly Kåñëa  conscious. A\\ndirectly Kåñëa conscious person is th e topmost transcendentalist because such\\na devotee knows what is meant by Br ahman and Paramätmä. His knowledge of\\nthe Absolute Truth is perfect, wherea s the impersonalist and the meditative\\nyogé are imperf ectly Kåñëa conscious.\\nNevertheless, all of these are instructed  herewith to be constantly engaged\\nin their particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest perfection\\nsooner or later. The first business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mindCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.always on Kåñëa. One sho uld always think of Kåñëa and not forget Him even\\nfor a moment. Concentration of th e mind on the Supreme is called samädhi,  or\\ntrance. In order to concentrate the mind, one should always remain in\\nseclusion and avoid disturbance by external objects. He sho uld be very careful\\nto accept favorable and reject unfavorable conditions that affect his\\nrealization. And, in perfect determination, he should not hanker after\\nunnecessary material things that entangle him by feelings of possessiveness.\\nAll these perfections and precautions are perfectly executed when one is\\ndirectly in Kåñëa consciousness, because direct Kåñëa consciousness means\\nself-abnegation, wherein there is very little chance for material possessiveness.\\nÇréla Rüpa Gosvämé characte rizes Kåñëa consciousness in this way:\\nanäsaktasya viñayän\\nyathärham upayuïjataù\\nnirbandhaù kåñëa-sambandhe\\nyuktaà vairägyam ucyate\\npräpaïcikatayä buddhyä\\nhari-sambandhi-vastunaù\\nmumukñubhiù parityägo\\nvairägyaà phalgu kathyate\\n“When one is not attached to anythi ng, but at the same time accepts\\neverything in relation to Kåñëa, one is rightly situated above possessiveness.\\nOn the other hand, one who rejects ev erything without knowledge of its\\nrelationship to Kåñëa is not as comple te in his renunciation.”\\n(Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  2.255–256 )\\nA Kåñëa conscious person well knows that  everything belongs to Kåñëa, and\\nthus he is always free from feelings of  personal possession.

In India the yogés,  the\\ntranscendentalists or the devotees, all leave home and reside in sacred places\\nsuch as Prayäga, Mathurä, Våndävana, Håñékeça and Hardwar and in solitude\\npractice yoga where the sacred r ivers like the Yamunä and the Ganges flow.\\nBut often this is not possible, especially for Westerners.

One who is not\\nself-controlled and whose mind is not undisturbed cannot practice meditation.\\nTherefore, in the Båhan-näradéya Puräëa  it is said that in Kali-yuga (the\\npresent yuga,  or age), when people in general are short-lived, slow in spiritual\\nrealiz ation and always disturbed by various anxieties, the best means of\\nspiritual realization is chanting the holy name of the Lord.\\nharer näma harer näma\\nharer nämaiva kevalam\\nkalau nästy eva nästy eva\\nnästy eva gatir anyathä\\n [Adi 17.21]\\n“In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is\\nchanting the holy name of the Lord.

The yoga process is\\npracticed in order to discover and see th is localized form of Viñëu, and not forCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.any other purpose. The localized viñëu-mürti  is the plenary representation of\\nKåñëa dwelling within one’s heart. On e who has no program to realize this\\nviñëu-mürti  is uselessly engaged in mock yoga practice and is certainly wasting\\nhis time. Kåñëa is the ultimate goal of life, a nd the viñëu-mürti  situated in one’s\\nheart is the object of yoga practice. To realize this viñëu-mürti  within the heart,\\none has to observe complete abstinence  from sex life; therefore one has to\\nleave home and live alone in a secluded place, remaining sea ted as mentioned\\nabove. One cannot enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend a\\nso-called yoga class and thus become a yogé. One has to practice controlling the\\nmind and avoiding all kinds of sense gratif ication, of which sex life is the chief.\\nIn the rules of celibacy written by the great sage Yäjïavalkya it is said:\\nkarmaëä manasä väcä\\nsarvävasthäsu sarvadä\\nsarvatra maithuna-tyägo\\nbrahmacaryaà pracakñate\\n“The vow of brahmacarya  is meant to help one completely abstain from sex\\nindulgence in work, words and mind—at all times, under all circumstances,\\nand in all places.” No one can perform correct yoga practice through sex\\nindulgence. Brahmacarya  is taught, t herefore, from childhood, when one has\\nno knowledge of sex life. Children at  the age of five are sent to the guru-kula,\\nor the place of the spiritual master, and the master trains the young boys in the\\nstrict discipline of becoming brahmacärés.  Without suc h practice, no one can\\nmake advancement in any yoga,  whether it be dhyäna, jïäna  or bhakti.  One\\nwho, however, follows the rules and regulations of married life, having a sexual\\nrelationship only with his wife (and that also under regulation), is also calle d a\\nbrahmacäré.  Such a restrained householder brahmacäré  may be accepted in the\\nbhakti  school, but the jïäna  and dhyäna  schools do not even admit householder\\nbrahmacärés.  They require complete abstinence without compromise. In the\\nbhakti  school, a househol der brahmacäré  is allowed controlled sex life because\\nthe cult of bhakti-yoga  is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual\\nattraction, being engaged in the supe rior service of the Lord.

Yoga  practice\\nis not meant for attaining any kind of ma terial facility; it is to enable the\\ncessation of all material existence. One who seeks an improvement in health\\nor aspires after material  perfection is no yogé according to Bhagavad-gétä.  Nor\\ndoes cessation of material existence en tail one’s entering into “the void,”\\nwhich is only a myth. There is no void  anywhere within the creation of the\\nLord. Rather, the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the\\nspiritual sky, the abode of the Lord. Th e abode of the Lord is also clearly\\ndescribed in the Bhagavad-gétä  as that place where there is no need of sun,\\nmoon or electricity. All the plan ets in the spiritual kingdom are\\nself-ill uminated like the sun in the mate rial sky. The kingdom of God is\\neverywhere, but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called paraà\\ndhäma,  or superior abodes.\\nA consummate yogé, who is perfect in understanding Lord Kåñëa, as is\\nclearly stated herein by the Lord Himself ( mat-cittaù, mat-paraù,\\nmat-sthänam ), can attain real peace and can ultimately reach His supreme\\nabode, Kåñëaloka, known as Goloka Våndävana. In the Brahma-saàhitä  (5.37)\\nit is clearly stated, goloka eva nivasaty akhilätma-bhütaù:  the Lord, although\\nresiding always in His abode called Go loka, is the all-pervading Brahman and\\nthe localized Paramätmä as well by dint  of His superior spiritual energies . No\\none can reach the spiritual sky (Vaikuëöha) or enter into the Lord’s eternal\\nabode (Goloka Våndävana) without the proper understanding of Kåñëa and\\nHis plenary expansion Viñëu. Therefore a person working in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness is the perfect yogé, bec ause his mind is always absorbed inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

In the Vedas  also\\n(Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  3.8) we learn, tam eva viditväti måtyum eti:  “One can\\novercome the path of birth and deat h only by understanding the Suprem e\\nPersonality of Godhead, Kåñëa.” In other words, perfection of the yoga system\\nis the attainment of freedom from ma terial existence and not some magical\\njugglery or gymnastic feats to befool innocent people.\\nTEXT  16\\nNaaTYaénTaSTau YaaeGaae_iSTa Na cEk-aNTaMaNaénTa\" )\\nNa caiTaSvPanXaql/SYa JaaGa]Taae NaEv caJauRNa )) 16 ))\\nnäty-açnatas ’tu yogo ’sti\\nna caikäntam anaçnataù\\nna cäti-svapna-çélasya\\njägrato naiva cärjuna\\nSYNONYMS\\nna—never; ati—too much; açnataù —of one who eats; tu—but; yogaù —linking\\nwith the Supreme; asti—there is; na—nor; ca—also; ekäntam —overly;\\nanaçnataù —abstaining from eating; na—nor; ca—also; ati—too much;\\nsvapna-çélasya —of one who sleeps; jägrataù —or one who keeps night watch\\ntoo much; na—not; eva—ever; ca—and; arjuna —O Arjuna.\\nTRANSLATION\\nThere is no possibility of one’s becoming a yogé, O Arjuna, if one eats too\\nmuch or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough.\\nPURPORT\\nRegulation of diet and sleep is recommended herein for the yogés.  Too much\\neating means eating more than is requir ed to keep the body and soul together.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.There is no need for men to eat animal s, because there is an ample supply of\\ngrains, vegetables, fruits  and milk. Such simple foodstuff is considered to be in\\nthe mode of goodness according to the Bhagavad-gétä.  Animal food is for those\\nin the mode of ignorance. Therefore,  those who indulge in animal food,\\ndrinking, smoking and eating food which is not firs t offered to Kåñëa will\\nsuffer sinful reactions because of eating only polluted things. Bhuïjate te tv\\naghaà päpä ye pacanty ätma-käraëät . Anyone who eats for sense pleasure, or\\ncooks for himself, not offering his food to Kåñëa, eats only sin. One who eats\\nsin and eats more than is allo tted to him cannot execute perfect yoga.  It is best\\nthat one eat only the remnants of f oodstuff offered to Kåñëa. A person in\\nKåñëa consciousness does not eat anything which is not first offered to Kåñëa.\\nTherefore, only the Kåñëa conscious person can attain perfection in yoga\\npractice. Nor can one who artificially abstains from eating, manufacturing his\\nown personal process of fasting, practice yoga.  The Kåñëa conscious person\\nobserves fasting as it is recommended in the scri ptures. He does not fast or eat\\nmore than is required, and he is thus competent to perform yoga practice. One\\nwho eats more than required will dream very much while sleeping, and he must\\nconsequently sleep more than is required. One should not sleep more t han six\\nhours daily. One who sleeps more than si x hours out of twenty-four is certainly\\ninfluenced by the mode of ignorance. A person in the mode of ignorance is\\nlazy and prone to sleep a great deal.

As far as eating is concerned, it can be regulated only when\\none is practiced to take and accept prasädam,  sanctified food. Lord Kåñëa is\\noffered, according to the Bhagavad-gétä  (9.26), vegetables, flowers, fruits,\\ngrains, milk, etc. In this way, a person in Kåñëa consciousness becomes\\nautomatically trained not to accept food not meant for human consumption,\\nor no t in the category of goodness. As far as sleeping is concerned, a Kåñëa\\nconscious person is always alert in the discharge of his duties in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness , and therefore any unnecessary time spent sleeping is considered\\na great loss. Avyartha-kälatvam:  [Cc. Madhya 23.18-19 ] a Kåñëa conscious\\nperson cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the\\nservice of the Lord. Therefore, his sleep ing is kept to a minimum. His ideal in\\nthis respect is Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé, who was always engaged in the service of\\nKåñëa and who could not sleep more than  two hours a day, and sometimes not\\neven that. Öhäkura Haridäsa would not even accept prasädam  nor even sleep\\nfor a moment without finishing his dail y routine of chanting with his beads\\nthree hundred  thousand names.

This perfection is\\ncharacterized by one’s ability to see the self by the pure mind and to relish and\\nrejoice in t he self. In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless\\ntranscendental happiness, realized thro ugh transcendental senses. Established\\nthus, one never departs from the truth, an d upon gaining this he thinks there is\\nno greater gain. Being situated in su ch a position, one is never shaken, even in\\nthe midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries\\narising from material contact.\\nPURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.By practice of yoga one becomes gradually detached from material concepts.\\nThis is the primary characteristic of the yoga principle. And after this, one\\nbecomes situated in trance, or samädhi,  which means that the yogé realizes the\\nSupersoul through transc endental mind and intelligence, without any of the\\nmisgivings of identifying the self with the Superself. Yoga  practice is more or\\nless based on the principles of the Pataïjali system. Some unauthorized\\ncommentators try to identify the individual soul with  the Supersoul, and the\\nmonists think this to be liberation, but they do not understand the real\\npurpose of the Pataïjali system of yoga.  There is an acceptance of\\ntranscendental pleasure in the Pataïjal i system, but the monists do not accept\\nthis transcen dental pleasure, out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness.\\nThe duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in\\nthis verse transcendental pleasure—realized through transcendental\\nsenses—is accepted. And this is corroborate d by Pataïjali Muni, the famous\\nexponent of the yoga system. The great sage declares in his Yoga-sütras  (3.34):\\npuruñärtha-çünyänäà guëänäà pratiprasavaù kaivalyaà svarüpa-pratiñöhä vä\\nciti-çaktir iti.\\nThis citi-çakti,  or internal potency, is transcendental. Puruñärtha  means\\nmaterial religiosity, economic developmen t, sense gratification and, at the end,\\nthe attempt to become one with th e Supreme. This “oneness with the\\nSupreme” is called kaivalyam  by th e monist. But according to Pataïjali, this\\nkaivalyam  is an internal, or transcendental , potency by which the living entity\\nbecomes aware of his constitutional posi tion. In the words of Lord Caitanya,\\nthis state of affairs is called ceto-darpaëa-märjanam  [Cc. Antya 20.12 ], or\\nclearance of the impure mirror of th e mind. This “clearance” is actually\\nliberation, or bhava-mahä-dävägni-nirväpaëam.  The theory of nirväëa —also\\npreliminary—corresponds with this principle. In the Bhägavatam  (2.10.6 ) this\\nis called svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù.  The Bhagavad-gétä  also confirms this situation\\nin this verse.\\nAfter nirväëa,  or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual\\nactivities, or devotional service to th e Lord, known as Kåñëa consciousness. In\\nthe words of the Bhägavatam,  svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù:  this is the “real life of the\\nliving entity.”  Mäyä,  or illusion, is the condition of spiritual life contaminatedCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.by material infection. Liberation from  this material infection does not mean\\ndestruction of the original eternal position of the living entity. Pataïjali also\\naccepts this by his words kaivalyaà svarüpa-pratiñöhä vä citi-çaktir iti.  This\\nciti-çakti,  or transcendental pleasure, is real life. This is confirmed in the\\nVedänta-sütra  (1.1.12 ) as änanda-mayo ’bhyäsät.  This natural transcendental\\npleasure is the ultimate goal of yoga and is easily  achieved by execution of\\ndevotional service, or bhakti-yoga.  Bhakti-yoga  will be vividly described in the\\nSeventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä.\\nIn the yoga system, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of\\nsamädhi,  called samprajïäta-samädhi  and asamprajïäta-samädhi.  When one\\nbecomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical\\nresearches, he is said to have achieved  samprajïäta-samädhi.  In the\\nasamprajïäta-samädhi  there is no longer any connection with mundane\\npleasure, for one is then transcendental  to all sorts of happiness derived from\\nthe senses. When the yogé is once situated in that  transcendental position, he\\nis never shaken from it. Unless the yogé is able to reach this position, he is\\nunsuccessful. Today’s so-called yoga practice, which involves various sense\\npleasures, is contradictory. A yogé indulging in sex and intoxication is a\\nmockery. Even those yogés  who are attracted by the siddhis  (perfections) in the\\nprocess of yoga are not perfectly situated. If yogés  are attracted by the\\nby-products of yoga,  then they cannot attain the stage of perfection, as is\\nstated in this verse. Persons, therefore, indulging in the make-show practice of\\ngymnastic feats or siddhis  should know that the aim of yoga is lost in that way.\\nThe best practice of yoga in this age is Kåñëa consciousness, which is not\\nbaffling. A Kåñëa conscious person is so  happy in his occupation that he does\\nnot aspire after any other happiness. Th ere are many impediments, especially\\nin this age of hypocrisy, to practicing haöha-yoga, dhyäna-yoga  and jïäna-yoga,\\nbut there is no such problem in executing karma-yoga  or bhakti-yoga.\\nAs long as the material body exists , one has to meet the demands of the\\nbody, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. But a person who is in\\npure bhakti-yoga,  or in Kåñëa consciousness, does not arouse the senses while\\nmeeting the demands of the bod y. Rather, he accepts the bare necessities of\\nlife, making the best use of a bad barg ain, and enjoys transcendental happinessCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.in Kåñëa consciousness. He is callous toward incidental occurrences—such as\\naccidents, disease, scarcity and even the death of a m ost dear relative—but he\\nis always alert to execute his duties in Kåñëa consciousness, or bhakti-yoga.\\nAccidents never deviate him from his duty. As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä\\n(2.14), ägamäpäyino ’nityäs täàs titikñasva bhärata.  He endures all such\\nincide ntal occurrences because he knows th at they come and go and do not\\naffect his duties. In this way he achieves the highest perfection in yoga\\npractice.\\nTEXT  24\\nSa iNaêYaeNa Yaae¢-VYaae YaaeGaae_iNaivR<aceTaSaa )\\nSaªLPaPa[>avaNk-aMaa&STYa¤-a SavaRNaXaezTa\" )\\nMaNaSaEveiNd]YaGa]aMa& iviNaYaMYa SaMaNTaTa\" )) 24 ))\\nsa niçcayena yoktavyo\\nyogo ’nirviëëa-cetasä\\nsaìkalpa-prabhavän kämäàs\\ntyaktvä sarvän açeñataù\\nmanasaivendriya-grämaà\\nviniyamya samantataù\\nSYNONYMS\\nsaù—that; niçcayena —with firm determination; yoktavyaù —must be\\npracticed; yogaù —yoga system; anirviëëa-cetasä —without deviation;\\nsaìkalpa —mental speculations; prabhavän —born of; kämän —material desires;\\ntyaktvä —giving up; sarvän —all; açeñataù —completely; manasä —by the mind;\\neva—certainly; indriya-grämam —the full set of senses; viniyamya —regulating;\\nsamantataù —from all sides.\\nTRANSLATION\\nOne should engage oneself in the prac tice of yoga with determination andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

One shou ld be sure of success at the end and\\npursue this course with great persever ance, not becoming discouraged if there\\nis any delay in the attainm ent of success.

Regarding bhakti-yoga,  Rüpa Gosvämé says:\\nutsähän niçcayäd dhairyät\\ntat-tat-karma-pravartanät\\nsaìga-tyägät sato våtteù\\nñaòbhir bhaktiù prasidhyati\\n“One can execute the process of bhakti-yoga  successfully with full-hearted\\nenthusiasm, perseverance, and determination, by following the prescribed\\nduties in the association of devotees and by engaging completely in activities\\nof goodness.” ( Upadeçämåta  3)\\nAs for determination, one should fo llow the example of the sparrow who\\nlost her eggs in the waves of the ocean.  A sparrow laid her eggs on the shore of\\nthe ocean, but the big ocean carried away  the eggs on its waves. The sparrow\\nbecame very upset and asked  the ocean to return her eggs. The ocean did not\\neven consider her appeal. So the spa rrow decided to dry up the ocean. She\\nbegan to pick out the water in her small beak, and everyone laughed at her for\\nher impossible determination. The news of her activity  spread, and at last\\nGaruòa, the gigantic bird carrier of Lord Viñëu, heard it. He became\\ncompassionate toward his small sister bird, and so he came to see the sparrow.\\nGaruòa was very pleased by the determination of the small sparrow, and he\\npromised to h elp. Thus Garuòa at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest\\nhe himself take up the work of the spa rrow. The ocean was frightened at this,\\nand returned the eggs. Thus the sparrow became happy by the grace of Garuòa.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

That is the supremeCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.neutrality of the Lord. The indivi dual soul is also situated in  the individual\\nheart, but he is not present in all hear ts. That is the distinction between the\\nindividual soul and the Supersoul. One who is not factually in the practice of\\nyoga cannot see so clearly. A Kåñëa conscious person can see Kåñëa in the\\nheart o f both the believer and the nonbeliever. In the småti  this is confirmed\\nas follows: ätatatväc ca mätåtväc ca ätmä hi paramo hariù . The Lord, being the\\nsource of all beings, is like the moth er and the maintainer. As the mother is\\nneutral to all different ki nds of children, the supreme father (or mother) is\\nalso. Consequently the Supersoul is always in every living being.\\nOutwardly, also, every living being is situated in the energy of the Lord. As\\nwill be explained in the Seventh Chapter , the Lord has, primarily, two\\nenergies—the spiritual (or superior) and the material (or inferior). The living\\nentity, although part of th e superior energy, is conditioned by the inferior\\nenergy; the living entity is always in the Lord’s energy. Every living entity is\\nsituated in Him in one way or another.\\nThe yogé sees equally because he sees that  all living entities, although in\\ndifferent situations according to the results of fruitive work, in all\\ncircumstances remain the servants of Go d. While in the material energy, the\\nliving entity serves the material  senses; and while in spiritual energy, he serves\\nthe Supreme Lord directly.

Such a person may appear to see all separate\\nmanifestations of the material nature, but in each and every instance he is\\nconscious of Kåñëa, knowing that  everything is a manifestation of Kåñëa’s\\nenergy. Nothing can exist without Kåñëa, and Kåñëa is the Lord of\\neverything—this is the basic principle of Kåñëa consciousness. Kåñëa\\nconsciousness is the development of lo ve of Kåñëa—a position transcendental\\neven to material liberation. At this stage of Kåñëa consciousness, beyond\\nself-realization, the devotee becomes on e with Kåñëa in the sense that Kåñëa\\nbecomes everything for the devotee and the devotee becomes full in loving\\nKåñëa. An intimate relationship be tween the Lord and the devotee then exists.\\nIn that stage, the living entity can neve r be annihilated, nor is the Personality\\nof Godhead ever out of the sight of the devotee. To merge in Kåñëa is spiritual\\nannihilation. A devotee takes no such risk. It is stated in the Brahma-saàhitä\\n(5.38):\\npremäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena\\nsantaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti\\nyaà çyämasundaram acintya-guëa-svarüpaà\\ngovindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämiCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

It  is not possible for an ordinary man to\\nleave home and go to a secl uded place in the mountain s or jungles to practice\\nyoga in this Age of Kali. The present age is characterized by a bitter struggle\\nfor a life of short duration. People are not serious about self-realization even by\\nsimple, practical means, and what to spea k of this difficult yoga system, which\\nregulates the mode of living, the manne r of sitting, selection of place, and\\ndetachment of the mind from material engagements. As a practical man,\\nArjuna thought it was impossibl e to follow this system of yoga,  even t hough he\\nwas favorably endowed in many ways.

Five thousand years ago, Arjuna had\\nmuch better facilities than we do now, yet he refused to accept this system of\\nyoga.  In fact, we do not find any record in history of his practicing it at any\\ntime. Therefore this system must be c onsidered generally impossible in this\\nAge of Kali.

But at the same time He suggests that\\nby practice and detachment it is possible.  What is that practice? In the present\\nage no one can obser ve the strict rules and regula tions of placing oneself in a\\nsacred place, focusing the mind on th e Supersoul, restraining the senses and\\nmind, observing celibacy, remaining alone, etc. By the practice of Kåñëa\\nconsciousness, however, one engages in nine ty pes of devotional service to the\\nLord. The first and foremost of such de votional engagements is hearing about\\nKåñëa. This is a very powerful transc endental method for purging the mind of\\nall misgivings. The more one hears about Kåñëa, the more one becomes\\nenlightened and detached from everyt hing that draws the mind away from\\nKåñëa. By detaching the mind from acti vities not devoted to the Lord, one can\\nvery easily learn vairägya.  Vairägya  means detachment from matter andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

This is practical\\nbecause by hearing about Kåñëa one be comes automatically attached to the\\nSupreme Spirit. This attachment is called pareçänubhava,  spiritual  satisfaction.\\nIt is just like the feeling of satisfac tion a hungry man has for every morsel of\\nfood he eats. The more one eats while hungry, the more one feels satisfaction\\nand strength. Similarly, by discharg e of devotional service one feels\\ntranscendent al satisfaction as the mind becomes detached from material\\nobjectives. It is something like curi ng a disease by expert treatment and\\nappropriate diet. Hearing of the transc endental activities of Lord Kåñëa is\\ntherefore expert treatment for the mad mind, an d eating the foodstuff offered\\nto Kåñëa is the appropriate diet for the suffering patient.

These are transcendental, beyond both body\\nand mind. Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, by the practice\\nof the eightfold system or by bhakti-yoga.  In each of these processes one has to\\nrealize the constitutional positi on of the living entity, his relationship with\\nGod, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve\\nthe highest perfectional stage of Kåñëa consciousness. Following any of the\\nabove-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner\\nor later. This was asserted by the Lord in the Second Chapter : even a little\\nendeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance. Out\\nof these three methods, the path of bhakti-yoga  is especially suitable for this\\nage because it is the most direct meth od of God realization. To be doubly\\nassured, Arjuna is asking Lord Kåñëa to confirm His former statement. One\\nmay sincerely accept the path of self-rea lization, but the process of cultivation\\nof knowledge and the practic e of the eightfold yoga system are generally very\\ndifficult for this age. Therefore, desp ite constant endeavor one may fail, for\\nmany reasons. First of all, one may no t be sufficiently serious about followingCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Consequently, whenever a person tries to escape the\\nclutches of the illusory energy, she tries to defeat the practitioner by various\\nallurements. A conditioned soul is already allured by the modes of m aterial\\nenergy, and there is every chance of being allured again, even while\\nperforming transcendental disciplines.

All Rights Reserved.There are two ways to progress. Those who are materialists have no interest\\nin transcendence; therefore they are mo re interested in material advancement\\nby economic development, or in promotion to the higher planets by\\nappropriate work. When one takes to t he path of transcendence, one has to\\ncease all material activities and sacrifice all forms of so-called material\\nhappiness. If the aspiring transcendentalis t fails, then he apparently loses both\\nways; in other words, he can enjoy neither material happiness  nor spiritual\\nsuccess. He has no position; he is like a riven cloud. A cloud in the sky\\nsometimes deviates from a small cloud an d joins a big one. But if it cannot join\\na big one, then it is blown away by the wind and becomes a nonentity in the\\nvast sky. The brahmaëaù pathi  is the path of transcendental realization\\nthrough knowing oneself to be spiritual in essence, part and parcel of the\\nSupreme Lord, who is manifested as Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän. Lord\\nÇré Kåñëa is the fullest manifestation of the Supreme Absolute Truth, and\\ntherefore one who is surrendered to  the Supreme Person is a successful\\ntranscendentalist.

Now, Arjuna wants to know  of the future of the unsuccessful\\ntranscendentalist.

A transc endentalist is supposed to give up all\\nmaterial activities for the sake of spiritual advancement in life, KåñëaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

One may argue that by Kåñëa consciousne ss one may attain the\\nhighest perfection if it is completed,  but if one does not attain such a\\nperfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritually. It is enjoined\\nin the scriptures that one has to suffer the reaction for not executing\\nprescri bed duties; therefore one who fails to discharge transcendental\\nactivities properly becomes subjected to these reactions. The Bhägavatam\\nassures the unsuccessful transcendentalis t that there need be no worries. Even\\nthough he may be subjected to the reacti on for not perfectly executing\\nprescribed duties, he is still not a loser, because auspicious Kåñëa consciousness\\nis never forgotten, and one so engaged will continue to be so even if he is\\nlowborn in the next life. On the other hand, one who simply follow s strictly\\nthe prescribed duties need not necessarily attain auspicious results if he is\\nlacking in Kåñëa consciousness.\\nThe purport may be understood as follows. Humanity may be divided into\\ntwo sections, namely, the regulated and the nonregulated. Those who are\\nengaged simply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of their next\\nlife or spiritual salvation belong  to the nonregulated section. And those who\\nfollow the principles of prescribed du ties in the scriptures are classified\\namongst the regulated section. The nonregulated section, both civilized and\\nnoncivilized, educated and noneducated, strong and weak, are  full of animal\\npropensities. Their activities are never auspicious, because while enjoying the\\nanimal propensities of eating, sleeping, defending and mating, they perpetually\\nremain in material existence, which is  always miserable. On the other hand,\\nthose who are regulated by scriptural injunctions, and who thus rise gradually\\nto Kåñëa consciousness, certainly progress in life.\\nThose who are following the path of  auspiciousness can be divided into\\nthree sections, namely (1) the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who\\nare enjoying material prosperity, (2) those who are trying to find ultimate\\nliberation from material exi stence, and (3) those who are devotees in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness. Those who are following the rules and regulations of the\\nscriptures for material happiness may be further divided into two classes: those\\nwho are fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense gratification.\\nThose who are after fruitive results for se nse gratification may be elevated to aCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

That is My\\nopinion.\\nPURPORT\\nThe word bhajate  is significant here. Bhajate  has its root in the verb bhaj,\\nwhich is used when there is need of  service. The English word “worship”\\ncannot be used in the same sense as bhaj.  Worship means to adore, or to show\\nrespect and honor to the worth y one. But service with love and faith is\\nespecially meant for the Supreme Pers onality of Godhead. One can avoid\\nworshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called discourteous, but\\none cannot avoid serving the Suprem e Lord without being thoroughl y\\ncondemned. Every living entity is part  and parcel of the Supreme Personality\\nof Godhead, and thus every living enti ty is intended to serve the Supreme\\nLord by his own constitution. Failin g to do this, he falls down. The\\nBhägavatam  (11.5.3 ) confirms this as follows:\\nya eñäà puruñaà säkñäd\\nätma-prabhavam éçvaramCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.na bhajanty avajänanti\\nsthänäd bhrañöäù patanty adhaù\\n“Anyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the\\nprimeval Lord, who is the source of a ll living entities, will certainly fall down\\nfrom his constitutional position.”\\nIn this verse also the word bhajanti  is used. Therefore, bhajanti  is applicable\\nto the Supreme Lord only, whereas th e word “worship” can be applied to\\ndemigods or to any other common living entity. The word avajänanti,  used in\\nthis verse of Çrémad-Bhägavat am, is also found in the Bhagavad-gétä.  Avajänanti\\nmäà müòhäù : “Only the fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead, Lord Kåñëa.” Such fools ta k e  i t  u p o n  t h e m s e l v e s  t o  w r i t e\\ncommentaries on the Bhagavad-gétä  without an attitude of service to the Lord.\\nConsequently they cannot properly distinguish between the word bhajanti  and\\nthe word “worship.”\\nThe culmination of all kinds of yoga practices lies in bhakti yoga.  All other\\nyogas  are but means to come to the point of bhakti  in bhakti-yoga.  Yoga  actually\\nmeans bhakti-yoga;  all other yogas  are progressions toward the destination of\\nbhakti-yoga.  From t he beginning of karma-yoga  to the end of bhakti-yoga  is a\\nlong way to self-realization. Karma-yoga,  without fruitive results, is the\\nbeginning of this path. When karma-yoga  increases in knowledge and\\nrenunciation, the stage is called jïäna-yoga.  When jïäna -yoga  increases in\\nmeditation on the Supersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is\\non Him, it is called añöäìga-yoga.  And when one surpasses the añöäìga-yoga\\nand comes to the point of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kåñëa, it is\\ncalled bhak ti yoga,  the culmination. Factually, bhakti-yoga  is the ultimate goal,\\nbut to analyze bhakti-yoga  minutely one has to understand these other yogas.\\nThe yogé who is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good\\nfortune. One who sticks to a parti cular point and does not make further\\nprogress is called by that particular name: karma-yogé, jïäna-yogé  or\\ndhyäna-yogé, räja-yogé, haöha-yogé,  etc. If one is fortunate enough to come to the\\npoint of bhakti-yoga,  it is to be understood that he has surpasse d all other yogas.\\nTherefore, to become Kåñëa conscious is the highest stage of yoga,  just as,\\nwhen we speak of Himälayan, we refe r to the world’s highest mountains, ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.which the highest peak, Mount Everest, is considered to be the culmination.\\nIt is by great fortune that one comes to Kåñëa consciousness on the path of\\nbhakti-yoga  to become well situated according to the Vedic direction. The ideal\\nyogé concentrates his attention on Kåñëa, who is called Çyämasundara, who is\\nas beautifully colored as a cloud, whose lotuslike face is as effulgent as the sun,\\nwhose dress is brilliant with jewels and whose body is flower-garlanded.\\nIlluminating all sides is His gorg eous luster, which is called the brahmajyoti.  He\\nincarnates in different forms such as R äma, Nåsiàha, Varäha and Kåñëa, the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, and He descends like a human being, as the\\nson of mother Yaçodä, and He is know n as Kåñëa, Govinda and Väsudeva. He\\nis the perfect child, husband, friend and master, and He is full with al l\\nopulences and transcendental qualities. If one remains fully conscious of these\\nfeatures of the Lord, he is called the highest yogi.\\nThis stage of highest perfection in yoga can be attained only by bhakti-yoga,\\nas is confirmed in all Vedic literature:\\nyasya deve parä bhaktir\\nyathä deve tathä gurau\\ntasyaite kathitä hy arthäù\\nprakäçante mahätmanaù\\n“Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and\\nthe spiritual master are all the impo rts of Vedic knowledge automatically\\nrevealed.” [ ÇU 6.23(526) ]\\nBhaktir asya bhajanaà tad ihämutropädhi-nairäsyenämuñmin\\nmanaù-kalpanam, etad eva naiñkarmyam.  “Bhakti  means devotional service to\\nthe Lord which is free from desire for material profit, either in this life or in\\nthe next. Devoid of such inclinations, one should fully absorb the mind in the\\nSupreme. That is the purpose of naiñkarmya. ” (Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad  1.15)\\nThese are some of the means for performance of bhakti,  or Kåñëa\\nconsciousness, the highest perfectional stage of the yoga system.\\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Sixth Chapter of the Çrémad\\nBhagavad-gétä  in the matter of Dhyäna-yoga.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Kåñëa is full in all opulences, and how He\\nmanifests such opulences is described herein. Also, four kinds of fortunate\\npeople who become attached to Kåñëa and f our kinds of unfortunate people\\nwho never take to Kåñëa are described in this chapter.\\nIn the first six chapters of Bhagavad-gétä,  the living entity has been\\ndescribed as nonmaterial spirit so ul capable of elevating himself to\\nself-realization by different types of yogas.  At the end of the Sixth Chapter, it\\nhas been clearly stated that the s teady concentration of the mind upon Kåñëa,\\nor in other words Kåñëa consciousn ess, is the highest form of all yoga.  By\\nconcentrating one’s mind upon Kåñëa, on e is able to know the Absolute Truth\\ncompletely, but not otherwise. Impersonal brahmajyoti  or loca lized Paramätmä\\nrealization is not perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth, because it is\\npartial. Full and scientific knowledge is Kåñëa, and everything is revealed to\\nthe person in Kåñëa consciousness. In complete Kåñëa consciousness one\\nknows that Kåñëa  is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts. Different types of\\nyoga are only steppingstones on the pa th of Kåñëa consciousness. One who\\ntakes directly to Kåñëa consciousness automatically knows about brahmajyoti\\nand Paramätmä in full. By practice of Kåñëa co nsciousness yoga,  one can know\\neverything in full—namely the Absolu te Truth, the living entities, the\\nmaterial nature, and their manifestations with paraphernalia.\\nOne should therefore begin yoga practice as directed in the last verse of the\\nSixth Chapter. Concentration of the mi nd upon Kåñëa the Supreme is made\\npossible by prescribed devotional servic e in nine different forms, of which\\nçravaëam  is the first and most  important. The Lord therefore says to Arjuna,\\ntac chåëu,  or “Hear from Me.” No one can be a greater authority than Kåñëa,\\nand therefore by hearing from Him one receives the greatest opportunity to\\nbecome a perfectly Kåñëa conscious person. One has therefo re to learn fromCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Kåñëa directly or from a pure devotee of Kåñëa—and not from a nondevotee\\nupstart, puffed up with academic education.\\nIn the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  this process of understanding Kåñëa, the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, the Ab solute Truth, is described in the\\nSecond Chapter of the First Canto as follows:\\nçåëvatäà sva-kathäù kåñëaù\\npuëya-çravaëa-kértanaù\\nhådy antaù-stho hy abhadräëi\\nvidhunoti suhåt satäm\\nnañöa-präyeñv abhadreñu\\nnityaà bhägavata-sevayä\\nbhagavaty uttama-çloke\\nbhaktir bhavati naiñöhiké\\ntadä rajas-tamo-bhäväù\\nkäma-lobhädayaç ca ye\\nceta etair anäviddhaà\\nsthitaà sattve prasédati\\nevaà prasanna-manaso\\nbhagavad-bhakti-yogataù\\nbhagavat-tattva-vijïänaà\\nmukta-saìgasya jäyate\\nbhidyate hådaya-granthiç\\nchidyante sarva-saàçayäù\\nkñéyante cäsya karmäëi\\ndåñöa evätmanéçvare\\n“To hear about Kåñëa from Vedic literatures, or to hear from Him directly\\nthrough the Bhagavad-gétä,  is itself righteous activity.

In this way, a devotee naturally develops his dormantCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.transcendental knowledge. As he hears more about Kåñëa from the\\nBhägavatam  and from the devotees, he become s fixed in the devotional service\\nof th e Lord. By development of devotional service one becomes freed from the\\nmodes of passion and ignorance, and thus material lusts and avarice are\\ndiminished.

Generally mankind is\\nsimply engaged in the anima l propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending\\nand mating, and hardly anyone is intere sted in transcendental knowledge. The\\nfirst six chapters of the Gétä are meant for those who are interested in\\ntranscendental knowledge, in understanding the self, th e Superself and the\\nprocess of realization by jïäna-yoga, dhyäna-yoga  and discrimination of the self\\nfrom matter. However, Kåñëa can be know n only by persons who are in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal Brahman\\nrealizatio n, for this is easier than unders tanding Kåñëa. Kåñëa is the Supreme\\nPerson, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman and\\nParamätmä. The yogés  and jïänés  are confused in their attempts to understand\\nKåñëa. Although the greatest of the imp ersonalists, Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya, has\\nadmitted in his Gétä commentary that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead, his followers do not accept Kåñëa as such, for it is very difficult to\\nknow Kåñëa, even though one has transcendental realization of im personal\\nBrahman.\\nKåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the\\nprimeval Lord Govinda.

Although nonde votees declare that the path of\\nbhakti,  or devotional service, is very easy, they cannot practice it.

Even the\\ngreat demigods are sometimes confused about Kå ñëa ( muhyanti yat sürayaù ).\\nMäà tu veda na kaçcana : “No one knows Me as I am,” the Lord says. And if\\none does know Him, then sa mahätmä su-durlabhaù . “Such a great soul is very\\nrare.” Therefore unless one practices devotional service to the Lord, one\\ncanno t know Kåñëa as He is ( tattvataù ), even though one is a great scholar or\\nphilosopher. Only the pure devotees can know something of the inconceivable\\ntranscendental qualities in Kåñëa, in the cause of all causes, in His\\nomnipotence and opulence, and in His wealth, fame, strength, beauty,\\nknowledge and renunciation, because Kåñë a is benevolently inclined to His\\ndevotees. He is the last word in Brahman realization, and the devotees alone\\ncan realize Him as He is.

The first one, Mahä-Viñëu, creates the total material energy, known as\\nthe mahat-tattva.  The second, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, enters into all the\\nuniverses to create diversities in e ach of them. The third, Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu,\\nis diffused as the all-pervading Supersou l in all the universes and is known as\\nParamätmä. He is present even within the atoms. Anyone who knows these\\nthree Viñëus can be liberated from material entanglement.”\\nThis material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies of\\nthe Lord. All the activities of the material world are directed by these three\\nViñëu expansions of Lord Kåñëa. These puruñas  are called incarnations.\\nGenerally one who does not know  the science of God (Kåñëa) assumes that\\nthis material world is for the enjoymen t of the living entities and that the\\nliving entities are the puruñas —the causes, controllers and enjoyers of the\\nmaterial energy. According to Bhagavad-gétä  this atheistic con clusion is false.\\nIn the verse under discussion it is stated  that Kåñëa is the original cause of the\\nmaterial manifestation. Çrémad-Bhägavatam  also confirms this. The ingredients\\nof the material manifestation are separated energies of the Lord. Even the\\nbrahmajyoti,  which is the ultimate goal of the impersonalists, is a spiritual\\nenergy manifested in the spiritual sky. There are no spiritual diversities in the\\nbrahmajyoti  as there are in the Vaikuëöhalokas, and the impersonalist accepts\\nthis brahmajyoti  as the ultimate eternal goal. The Paramätmä manifestation is\\nalso a temporary all-pervasive aspect of the Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu. The\\nParamätmä manifestation is not eternal in the spiritual world. Therefore the\\nfactual Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality o f Godhead Kåñëa. He is\\nthe complete energetic person, and He possesses different separated and\\ninternal energies.\\nIn the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above\\nmentioned. Out of these, the first five  manifestations, namely earth, water,\\nfire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the gross creations,\\nwithin which the five se nse objects are included. They are the manifestations\\nof physical sound, touch, form, taste and smell. Material science comprises\\nthese ten items and nothing more. But the other three items, namely mind,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.intelligence and false ego, are neglected by the mat erialists. Philosophers who\\ndeal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge because they do\\nnot know the ultimate source, Kåñëa. Th e false ego—“I am,” and “It is mine,\\nwhich constitute the basic principle of  material existence—includes ten se nse\\norgans for material activities. Intelligenc e refers to the total material creation,\\ncalled the mahat-tattva.  Therefore from the eight separated energies of the\\nLord are manifest the twenty-four elemen ts of the material world, which are\\nthe subject matt er of Säìkhya atheistic philosophy; they are originally\\noffshoots from Kåñëa’s energies and ar e separated from Him, but atheistic\\nSäìkhya philosophers with a poor fund  of knowledge do not know Kåñëa as\\nthe cause of all causes. The subject matter for discus sion in the Säìkhya\\nphilosophy is only the manifestation of the external energy of Kåñëa, as it is\\ndescribed in the Bhagavad-gétä.\\nTEXT  5\\nAPareYaiMaTaSTvNYaa& Pa[k*-iTa& iviÖ Mae ParaMa( )\\nJaqv>aUTaa& Mahabahae YaYaed& DaaYaRTae JaGaTa( )) 5 ))\\napareyam itas tv anyäà\\nprakåtià viddhi me paräm\\njéva-bhütäà mahä-bäho\\nyayedaà dhäryate jagat\\nSYNONYMS\\naparä —inferior; iyam —this; itaù—besides this; tu—but; anyäm —another;\\nprakåtim —energy; viddhi —just try to understand; me—My; paräm —superior;\\njéva-bhütäm —comprising the living entities; mahä-bäho —O mighty-armed\\none; yayä —by whom; idam —this; dhäryate —is utili zed or exploited; jagat —the\\nmaterial world.\\nTRANSLATIONCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The inferior energy is matter\\nmanifested in different elements, name ly earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind,\\nintelligence and false ego. Both f orms of material nature, namely gross (earth,\\netc.) and subtle (mind, etc.), are prod ucts of the inferior energy. The living\\nentities, who are exploiting these inferior energies for different purposes, are\\nthe superior energy of the Supreme Lord, and it is  due to this energy that the\\nentire material world functions. The cosmic manifestation has no power to act\\nunless it is moved by the superior energy , the living entity. Energies are always\\ncontrolled by the energetic, and therefore the living entities are always\\ncontrolled by the Lord—they have no independent existence. They are never\\nequally powerful, as unintelligent me n think. The distinction between the\\nliving entities and the Lord is described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.87.30 ) as\\nfollows:\\naparimitä dhruväs tanu-bhåto yadi sarva-gatäs\\ntarhi na çäsyateti niyamo dhruva netarathä\\najani ca yan-mayaà tad avimucya niyantå bhavet\\nsamam anujänatäà yad amataà mata-duñöatayä\\n“O Supreme Eternal! If the embodied living entities were eternal and\\nall-pervading like You, then they would not be under Your control. But if the\\nliving entities are accepted as minute en ergies of Your Lordship, then they are\\nat once subject to Your supre me control. Therefore real liberation entails\\nsurrender by the living entities to Yo ur control, and that surrender will make\\nthem happy. In that constitutional position only can they be controllers.\\nTherefore, men with limited knowledge who advocate the mo nistic theory that\\nGod and the living entities are equal in all respects are actually guided by aCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.faulty and polluted opinion.”\\nThe Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, is the only controller, and all living entities are\\ncontrolled by Him. These living entities are His superior energy because the\\nquality of their existence is one and th e same with the Supreme, but they are\\nnever equal to the Lord in quantity of power. While exploiting the gross and\\nsubtle inferior energy (matter), the superior energy (the living entity) forgets\\nhis real spiritual mind and intelligence. This forgetfulness is due to the\\ninfluence of matter upon the living entity. But  when the living entity becomes\\nfree from the influence of the illusory material energy, he attains the stage\\ncalled mukti,  or liberation. The false ego, under the influence of material\\nillusion, thinks, “I am matter, and ma terial acquisitions are mine.” H is actual\\nposition is realized when he is liberate d from all material ideas, including the\\nconception of his becoming one in all respects with God. Therefore one may\\nconclude that the Gétä confirms the living entity to be only one of the\\nmulti-energies of Kåñëa; and when this energy is freed from material\\ncontamination, it becomes fully Kåñëa conscious, or liberated.\\nTEXT  6\\nWTaÛaeNaqiNa >aUTaaiNa SavaR<aqTYauPaDaarYa )\\nAh& k*-TòSYa JaGaTa\" Pa[>av\" Pa[l/YaSTaQaa )) 6 ))\\netad-yonéni bhütäni\\nsarväëéty upadhäraya\\nahaà kåtsnasya jagataù\\nprabhavaù pralayas tathä\\nSYNONYMS\\netat—these two natures; yonéni —whose source of birth; bhütäni —everything\\ncreated; sarväëi —all; iti—thus; upadhäraya —know; aham —I;\\nkåtsnasya —all-inclusive; jagataù —of the world; prabhavaù —the source of\\nmanifestation; pralayaù —annihilation; tathä —as well as.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Spirit is the basic\\nfield of creation, and matter is created by spirit. Spirit is not created at a\\ncertain stage of material developmen t. Rather, this material world is\\nmanifested only on the basis of spiritual energy. This material body is\\ndeveloped because spirit is present within matter; a child grows gradually to\\nboyhood and then to manhood because that superior energy, spirit soul, is\\npresent. Similarly, the entire cosmic manifestation of the gi gantic universe is\\ndeveloped because of the presence of the Supersoul, Viñëu. Therefore spirit\\nand matter, which combine to manifest this gigantic universal form, are\\noriginally two energies of the Lord, an d consequently the Lord is the original\\ncause of e verything. A fragmental part and parcel of the Lord, namely the\\nliving entity, may be the cause of a big skyscraper, a big factory, or even a big\\ncity, but he cannot be the cause of a bi g universe. The cause of the big universe\\nis the big soul, or the Supe rsoul. And Kåñëa, the Supreme, is the cause of both\\nthe big and small souls. Therefore He is the original cause of all causes.

As far as Bhagavad-gétä  is concerned, the Absolute\\nTruth is the Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, and this is confirmed in every\\nstep. In this verse, in parti cular, it is stressed that the Absolute Truth is a\\nperson. That the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also\\nthe affirmation of the Brahma-saàhitä:  éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù\\nsac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù ; that is, the Supreme Absolute Truth Pers onality of\\nGodhead is Lord Kåñëa, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure,\\nGovinda, and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge. These\\nauthorities leave no doubt that the Abso lute Truth is the Supreme Person, the\\ncause of all cause s. The impersonalist, however, argues on the strength of the\\nVedic version given in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (3.10): tato yad uttarataraà\\ntad arüpam anämayam/ ya etad vidur amåtäs te bhavanti athetare duùkham\\neväpiyanti.  “In the material world Brahmä, the  primeval living entity within\\nthe universe, is understood to be th e supreme amongst the demigods, human\\nbeings and lower animals. But beyond Brahmä there is the Transcendence,\\nwho has no material form and is fr ee from all material contaminations.\\nAnyone w ho can know Him also becomes transcendental, but those who doCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

It indicates the transc endental form of eternity, bliss and\\nknowledge as described in the Brahma-saàhitä  quoted above. Other verses in\\nthe Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (3.8–9) substantiate this as follows:\\nvedäham etaà puruñaà mahäntam\\näditya-varëaà tamasaù parastät\\ntam eva viditväti måtyum eti\\nnänyaù panthä vidyate ’yanäya\\nyasmät paraà näparam asti kiïcid\\nyasmän näëéyo no jyäyo ’sti kiïcit\\nvåkña iva stabdho divi tiñöhaty ekas\\ntenedaà pürëaà puruñeëa sarvam\\n“I know that Supreme Personality of Godhead who is transcendental to all\\nmaterial conceptions of darkness.

The Supreme Lo rd can be preliminarily perceived by\\nHis different energies, and in this way He is realized impersonally. As the\\ndemigod in the sun is a person and is perceived by his all-pervading energy, the\\nsunshine, so the Lord, although in His eternal abode, is perceived by His\\nall-pervading diffusive energies. The taste of water is the active principle of\\nwater. No one likes to drink sea water, because the pure taste of water is mixed\\nwith salt. Attraction for water depends on  the purity of the taste, and this pure\\ntaste is one of the energies of the Lord. The impersonalist perceives the\\npresence of the Lord in water by it s taste, and the personalist also gl orifies the\\nLord for His kindly supplying tasty wate r to quench man’s thirst. That is the\\nway of perceiving the Supreme. Practi cally speaking, there is no conflict\\nbetween personalism and impersonalism.  One who knows God knows that the\\nimpersonal conceptio n and personal conception are simultaneously present inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Therefore Lord Caitanya\\nestablished His sublime doctrine: acintya\\nbheda -and- abheda-tattva —simultaneous oneness and difference.\\nThe light of the sun and the moon is also originally emanating from the\\nbrahmajyoti,  which is the impersonal effulgence of the Lord. And praëava,  or\\nthe oàkära  transcendental sound in the beginning of every Vedic hymn,\\naddresses the Supreme Lord. Because t he impersonalists are very much afraid\\nof addressing the Supreme Lord Kåñëa by His innumerable names, they prefer\\nto vibrate the transcendental sound oàkära.  But they do not realize that\\noàkära  is the sound representation of Kåñëa. The jurisdiction of Kåñë a\\nconsciousness extends everywhere, and one who knows Kåñëa consciousness is\\nblessed.

But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily\\ncross beyond it.\\nPURPORT\\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead has innumerable energies, and all\\nthese energies are divine. Although the li ving entities are part of His energies\\nand are therefore divine, due to contac t with material energy their original\\nsuperior power is covered. Be ing thus covered by material energy, one cannot\\npossibly overcome its influence. As previously stated, both the material and\\nspiritual natures, being emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\\nare eternal. The living entities belong to the eternal  superior nature of the\\nLord, but due to contamination by the in ferior nature, matter, their illusion is\\nalso eternal. The conditioned soul is therefore called nitya-baddha,  or eternally\\nconditioned. No one can trace out th e history of his becoming conditi oned at a\\ncertain date in material history. Consequently, his release from the clutches of\\nmaterial nature is very difficult, even though that material nature is an\\ninferior energy, because material ener gy is ultimately conducted by the\\nsupreme will, which  the living entity cannot overcome. Inferior, material\\nnature is defined herein as divine na ture due to its divine connection and\\nmovement by the divine will. Being conducted by divine will, material nature,\\nalthough inferior, acts so wonderfully in the co nstruction and destruction of\\nthe cosmic manifestation. The Vedas  confirm this as follows: mäyäà tu\\nprakåtià vidyän mäyinaà tu maheçvaram.  “Although mäyä  [illusion] is false or\\ntemporary, the background of mäyä  is the supreme magician, the Personality ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Godhead, who is Maheçvara, the supreme controller.” ( Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad\\n4.10)\\nAnother meaning of guëa  is rope; it is to be understood that the\\nconditioned soul is tightly tied by th e ropes of illusion. A man bound by the\\nhands and feet cannot free himself—he must be helped by a person who is\\nunbound. Because the bound cannot help th e bound, the rescuer must be\\nliberated. Therefore, only Lord Kåñëa,  or His bona fide representative the\\nspiritual master, can release the conditioned soul. Without such superior help,\\none cannot be freed from the bondage of material nature. Devotional serv ice,\\nor Kåñëa consciousness, can help one g ain such release. Kåñëa, being the Lord\\nof illusory energy, can order this in surmountable energy to release the\\nconditioned soul. He orders this release out of His causeless mercy on the\\nsurrendered soul and out o f His paternal affection for the living entity, who is\\noriginally a beloved son of the Lord. Th erefore surrender unto the lotus feet of\\nthe Lord is the only means to get fr ee from the clutches of the stringent\\nmaterial nature.\\nThe words mäm eva  are also significant. Mäm  means unto Kåñëa (Viñëu)\\nonly, and not Brahmä or Çiva. Although Brahmä and Çiva are greatly elevated\\nand are almost on the level of Viñëu, it  is not possible for such incarnations of\\nrajo-guëa  (passion) and tamo- guëa  (ignorance) to release the conditioned soul\\nfrom the clutches of mäyä.  In other words, both Brahmä and Çiva are also\\nunder the influence of mäyä.  Only Viñëu is the master of mäyä;  therefore He\\nalone can give release to the conditioned soul. The Vedas  (Çvetäçvatara\\nUpaniñad  3.8) confirm this in the phrase tam eva viditvä.  or “Freedom is\\npossible only by understanding Kåñëa.” Ev en Lord Çiva affirms that liberation\\ncan be achieved only by the mercy of Viñëu. Lord Çiva says, mukti-pradätä\\nsarveñäà viñëur e va na saàçayaù:  “There is no doubt that Viñëu is the deliverer\\nof liberation for everyone.”\\nTEXT  15\\nNa Maa& duZk*-iTaNaae MaU!a\" Pa[PaÛNTae NaraDaMaa\" )Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

At this point a ques tion arises: How is it that educated\\nphilosophers, scientists, businessmen, administrators and all the leaders of\\nordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of Çré Kåñëa, the all-powerful\\nPersonality of Godhead? Mukti,  or liberation from the laws of material nature,\\nis sought by the leaders of mankind in differen t ways and with great plans and\\nperseverance for a great many years and births. But if that liberation is possible\\nby simply surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead, then why don’t these intelligent and hard-working leaders a dopt this\\nsimple method?\\nThe Gétä answers this question very frankly. Those really learned leaders ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.society like Brahmä, Çiva, Kapila, the Kumäras, Manu, Vyäsa, Devala, Asita,\\nJanaka, Prahläda, Bali, and later on Madhväcärya, Rämänujäcärya, Çré\\nCaitanya and many others—who are f aithful philosophers, politicians,\\neducators, scientists, etc.—surrender to the lotus feet of the Supreme Person,\\nthe all-powerful authority. Those who are not actually philosophers, scientists,\\neducators, administrators, etc., but who pose themselves as s uch for material\\ngain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord. They have no idea\\no f  G o d ;  t h e y  s i m p l y  m a n u f a c t u r e  t h eir own worldly plans and consequently\\ncomplicate the problems of material existence in their vain attempts to solve\\nthem. Becaus e material energy (nature) is so powerful, it can resist the\\nunauthorized plans of the atheists and baffle the knowledge of “planning\\ncommissions.”\\nThe atheistic planmakers are described herein by the word duñkåtinaù,  or\\n“miscreants.” Kåté means one who has performed meritorious work. The atheist\\nplanmaker is sometimes very intellige nt and meritorious also, because any\\ngigantic plan, good or bad, must  take intelligence to execute. But because the\\natheist’s brain is improperly utilized in  opposing the plan of the Supreme Lord,\\nthe atheistic planmaker is called duñkåté.  which indicates that his intelligence\\nand efforts are misdirected.\\nIn the Gétä it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under\\nthe direction of the Supreme Lord. It ha s no independent authority. It works\\nas the shadow moves, in accordance with the movements of the object. But\\nstill material energy is very p owerful, and the atheist, due to his godless\\ntemperament, cannot know how it works;  nor can he know the plan of the\\nSupreme Lord. Under illusion and the mo des of passion and ignorance, all his\\nplans are baffled, as in the case of Hiraëyakaçipu and Rävaëa, whose plans\\nwere smashed to dust although they were  both materially learned as scientists,\\nphilosophers, administrators and educators. These duñkåtinas,  or miscreants,\\nare of four different patterns, as outlined below.\\n(1) The müòhas  are those who are grossly foolish, like hardworking beasts of\\nburden. They want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves, and so do\\nnot want to part with them for the Su preme. The typical example of the beast\\nof burden is the ass. Th is humble beast is made to work very hard by hisCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.master. The ass does not really know fo r whom he works so hard day and night.\\nHe remains satisfied by filling his stomac h with a bundle of grass, sleeping for a\\nwhile under fear of being beaten by his master , and satisfying his sex appetite\\nat the risk of being repeatedly kicked  by the opposite party. The ass sings\\npoetry and philosophy sometimes, but th is braying sound only disturbs others.\\nThis is the position of the foolis h fruitive worker who does not kno w for whom\\nhe should work. He does not know that karma  (action) is meant for yajïa\\n(sacrifice).\\nMost often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of\\nself-created duties say that they have no  time to hear of the immortality of the\\nliving being. To such müòhas,  material gains, which are destructible, are life’s\\nall in all—despite t he fact that the müòhas  enjoy only a very small fraction of\\nthe fruit of labor. Sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive\\ngain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, they are satisfied with\\npractically no food; they are simply  absorbed in working hard day and night for\\nthe benefit of illusory masters. Ignora nt of their real master, the foolish\\nworkers waste their valuable time serv ing mammon. Unfortunately, they never\\nsurrender to the supreme master of all masters, nor do they take time to hear of\\nHim from the proper sources. The swine who eat the night soil do not care to\\naccept sweetmeats made of sugar and ghee. Similarly, the foolish worker will\\nuntiringly continue to hear of the sense-enjoyable tidings of the flickering\\nmund ane world, but will have very little ti me to hear about the eternal living\\nforce that moves the material world.\\n(2) Another class of duñkåté,  or miscreant, is called the narädhama,  or the\\nlowest of mankind. Nara  means human being, and adhama  means the lowest.\\nOut of the 8,400,000 different species of living beings, there are 400,000\\nhuman species. Out of these there  are numerous lower forms of human life\\nthat are mostly uncivilized. The civi lized human beings are those who have\\nregulative principles of social, political and religious life. Those who are\\nsocially and politically developed but who have no religious pri nciples must be\\nconsidered narädhamas.  Nor is religion without God religion, because the\\npurpose of following religious principles is to know the Supreme Truth and\\nman’s relation with Him. In the Gétä the Personality of Godhead clearly statesCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.that there is  no authority above Him and that He is the Supreme Truth. The\\ncivilized form of human life is meant for man’s reviving the lost consciousness  of\\nhis eternal relation with the Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead Çré\\nKåñëa, who is all-powerful. Whoever  loses this chance is classified as a\\nnarädhama.  We get information from revealed scriptures that when the baby is\\nin the mother’s womb (an extremely un comfortable situation) he prays to God\\nfor deliverance and promises to wo rship Him alone as soon as he g ets out. To\\npray to God when he is in difficulty is a natural instinct in every living being\\nbecause he is eternally related with Go d. But after his deliverance, the child\\nforgets the difficulties of birth and forg ets his deliverer also, being influenced\\nby mäyä,  the illusory energy.\\nIt is the duty of the guardians of chil dren to revive the divine consciousness\\ndormant in them. The ten processes of reformatory ceremonies, as enjoined in\\nthe Manu-småti.  which is the guide to religious principles, are meant for\\nreviving God consciousness  in the system of varëäçrama.  However, no process\\nis strictly followed now in any part of  the world, and therefore 99.9 percent of\\nthe population is narädhama.\\nWhen the whole population becomes narädhama.  naturally all their\\nso-called education is made null and void by the all-powerful energy of\\nphysical nature. According to the standard of the Gétä,  a learned man is he\\nwho sees on equal terms the learned brähmaë a. the dog. the cow, the elephant\\nand the dog-eater. That is the vision of a true devotee. Çré Nityänanda Prabhu,\\nwho is the incarnation of Godhead as divine master, delivered the typical\\nnarädhamas.  the brothers Jagäi and Mädh äi, and showed how the mercy of a\\nreal devotee is bestowed upon the lowest of mankind. So the narädhama  who is\\ncondemned by the Personality of Godh ead can again revive his spiritual\\nconsciousness only by the mercy of a devotee.\\nÇré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, in propagating the bhägavata-dharma,  or\\nactivities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissively hear the\\nmessage of the Personality of Godhea d. The essence of this message is\\nBhagavad-gétä.  The lowest amongst human bei ngs can be delivered by this\\nsubmissive hearing process only, but unfo rtunately they even refuse to give an\\naural reception to these messages, and wh at to speak of surrendering to the willCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.of the Supreme Lord? Narädhamas,  or the lowest of mankind, will ful ly neglect\\nthe prime duty of the human being.\\n(3) The next class of duñkåté  is called mäyayäpahåta-jïänäù,  or those persons\\nwhose erudite knowledge has been nulli fied by the influence of illusory\\nmaterial energy. They are mostly very learned fellows—great philosophers,\\npoets, literati, scientists, etc .—but the illusory energy misguides them, and\\ntherefore they disobey the Supreme Lord.\\nThere are a great number of mäyayäpahåta-jïänäù  at the present moment,\\neven amongst the scholars of the Bhagavad-gétä.  In the Gétä,  in plain and\\nsimple language, it is stated that Çré Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead. There is none equal to or g reater than Him. He is mentioned as the\\nfather of Brahmä, the original father of all human beings. In fact, Çré Kåñëa is\\nsaid to be not only the father of Brahmä but also the father of all species of life.\\nHe is the root of the impersonal Brahman and Param ätmä; the Supersoul in\\nevery entity is His plenary portion. He is the fountainhead of everything, and\\neveryone is advised to surrender unto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear\\nstatements, the mäyayäpahåta-jïänäù  deride the personality of the Supreme\\nLord and consider Him merely another human being. They do not know that\\nthe blessed form of human life is desi gned after the eternal and transcendental\\nfeature of the Supreme Lord.\\nAll the unauthorized interpretations of the Gétä by the class of\\nmäyayäpahåta-jïänäù,  outside the purview of the paramparä  system, are so\\nmany stumbling blocks on the path of  spiritual understanding. The deluded\\ninterpreters do not surrender unto the lotus  feet of Çré Kåñëa, nor do they\\nteach others to follow this principle.\\n(4) The last class of duñkåté  is called äsuraà bhävam äçritäù,  or those of\\ndemonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them argue that the\\nSupreme Lord can never descend upon this material world, but they are unable\\nto give any tangible rea sons as to why not. There are others who make Him\\nsubordinate to the impersonal feature, al though the opposite is declared in the\\nGétä.  Envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the atheist will present\\na number of illicit incarnations manufactured in  the factory of his brain. Such\\npersons, whose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godhead,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.cannot surrender unto the lotus feet of Çré Kåñëa.\\nÇré Yämunäcärya Albandaru of South India said, “O my Lord! You are\\nunknowable to persons involved with  atheistic principles, despite Your\\nuncommon qualities, features and activities, despite Your personality’s being\\nconfirmed by all the revealed scriptures  in the quality of goodness, and despite\\nYour being acknowledged by the famous  authorities renowned for their depth\\nof knowledge in the transcendental science and situated in the godly\\nqualities.”\\nTherefore, (1) grossly foolish persons,  (2) the lowest of mankind, (3) the\\ndeluded speculators, and (4) the professed atheists, as above mentioned, never\\nsurrender unto the lotus feet of the Pe rsonality of Godhead in spite of all\\nscriptural and authoritati ve advice.\\nTEXT  16\\ncTauivRDaa >aJaNTae Maa& JaNaa\" Sauk*-iTaNaae_JauRNa )\\nAaTaaeR iJajaSaurQaaRQas jaNaq c >arTazR>a )) 16 ))\\ncatur-vidhä bhajante mäà\\njanäù sukåtino ’rjuna\\närto jijïäsur arthärthé\\njïäné ca bharatarñabha\\nSYNONYMS\\ncatuù-vidhäù —four kinds of; bhajante —render services; mäm —unto Me;\\njanäù —persons; su-kåtinaù —those who are pious; arjuna —O Arjuna;\\närtaù —the distressed; jijïäsuù —the inquisitive; artha-arthé —one who desires\\nmaterial gain; jïäné —one who knows things as they  are; ca—also;\\nbharata-åñabha —O great one amongst the descendants of Bharata.\\nTRANSLATION\\nO best among the Bhäratas, four kinds of pious men begin to renderCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Out of these there are four classes of\\nmen—those who are sometimes distressed, those who are in need of money,\\nthose who are sometimes inquisitive, and those who are sometimes searching\\nafter knowledge of the Absolute Tr uth. These persons come to the S upreme\\nLord for devotional service under different conditions. These are not pure\\ndevotees, because they have some aspi ration to fulfill in exchange for\\ndevotional service. Pure devotional service is without aspiration and without\\ndesire for material profi t. The Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  (1.1.11 ) defines pure\\ndevotion thus:\\nanyäbhiläñitä-çünyaà\\njïäna-karmädy-anävåtam\\nänukülyena kåñëänu-\\nçélanaà bhaktir uttamä\\n [Madhya 19.167 ]\\n“One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord\\nKåñëa favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive\\nactivities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.”\\nWhen these four kinds of persons come  to the Supreme Lord for devotional\\nservice and are completely purified by the association of a pure devotee, they\\nalso become pure devotees. As far as the miscreants are concerned, for them\\ndevotional service is very d ifficult because their lives are selfish, irregular and\\nwithout spiritual goals. But even some of them, by chance, when they come in\\ncontact with a pure devotee, also become pure devotees.\\nThose who are always busy with fruiti ve activities come to the Lord inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.material distress and at that time associate with pure devotees and become, in\\ntheir distress, devotees of the Lord. Th ose who are simply frustrated also come\\nsometimes to associate wit h the pure devotees and become inquisitive to know\\nabout God. Similarly, when the dry philos ophers are frustrated in every field of\\nknowledge, they sometimes want to le arn of God, and they come to the\\nSupreme Lord to render devotional service and thus tran scend knowledge of\\nthe impersonal Brahman and the loca lized Paramätmä and come to the\\npersonal conception of Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure\\ndevotee. On the whole, when the dist ressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of\\nknowledge, and tho se who are in need of money are free from all material\\ndesires, and when they fully understa nd that material remuneration has\\nnothing to do with spiritual improvemen t, they become pure devotees. As long\\nas such a purified stage is not attained, devotees in  transcendental service to\\nthe Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, the search for mundane\\nknowledge, etc. So one has to transcen d all this before one can come to the\\nstage of pure devotional service.\\nTEXT  17\\nTaeza& jaNaq iNaTYaYau¢- Wk->ai¢-ivRiXaZYaTae )\\niPa[Yaae ih jaiNaNaae_TYaQaRMah& Sa c MaMa iPa[Ya\" )) 17 ))\\nteñäà jïäné nitya-yukta\\neka-bhaktir viçiñyate\\npriyo hi jïänino ’tyartham\\nahaà sa ca mama priyaù\\nSYNONYMS\\nteñäm —out of them; jïäné —one in full knowledge; nitya-yuktaù —always\\nengaged; eka—only; bhaktiù —in devotional service; viçiñyate —is special;\\npriyaù —very dear; hi—certainly; jïäninaù —to the person in knowledge;\\natyartham —highly; aham —I am; saù—he; ca—also; mama—to Me;Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

All Rights Reserved.PURPORT\\nThe living entity, while executing de votional service or transcendental\\nrituals after many, many births, may actually become situated in\\ntranscendental pure knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is\\nthe ultimate goal of spiritual realization. In  the beginning of spiritual\\nrealization, while one is trying to gi ve up one’s attachment to materialism,\\nthere is some leaning towards impersonalism, but when one is further\\nadvanced he can understand that there ar e activities in the spiritual life and\\nthat these activities constitute devotional  service. Realizing this, he becomes\\nattached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrenders to Him. At\\nsuch a time one can understand that Lord Çré Kåñëa’s mercy is everything, that\\nHe is the cause of all caus es and that this material manifestation is not\\nindependent from Him. He realizes th e material world to be a perverted\\nreflection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is a\\nrelationship with the Supreme Lord Kåñëa. Thus he thinks  of everything in\\nrelation to Väsudeva, or Çré Kåñëa. Such a universal vision of Väsudeva\\nprecipitates one’s full surrender to the Supreme Lord Çré Kåñëa as the highest\\ngoal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare.\\nThis verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter (verses 14 and 15)\\nof the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad:\\nsahasra-çérñä puruñaù\\nsahasräkñaù sahasra-pät\\nsa bhümià viçvato våtvä-\\ntyätiñöhad daçäìgulam\\npuruña evedaà sarvaà\\nyad bhütaà yac ca bhavyam\\nutämåtatvasyeçäno\\nyad annenätirohati\\nIn the Chändogya Upaniñad  (5.1.15 ) it is said, na vai väco na cakñüàñi na\\nçroträëi na manäàséty äcakñate präëa iti eväcakñate präëo hy evaitäni sarväëiCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

As the supreme father of all\\nliving entities, He does not interfere with their independence, but gives all\\nfacilities so that they can fulfill thei r material desires. Some may ask why the\\nall-powerful God gives facilities to the living  entities for enjoying this material\\nworld and so lets them fall into the trap  of the illusory energy. The answer is\\nthat if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul do es not give such facilities, then thereCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.is no meaning to independence. Therefore He gives everyone full\\nindependence—whatever one likes—but His ultimate instruction we find in\\nthe Bhagavad-gétä:  one should give up all other engagements and fully\\nsurrender unto Him . That will make man happy.\\nBoth the living entity and the demigo ds are subordinate to the will of the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannot worship\\nthe demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow any benediction\\nwithout the supreme will. As it is said, not a blade of grass moves without the\\nwill of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally, persons who are\\ndistressed in the material world go to th e demigods, as they are advised in the\\nVedic literature. A person wanting some particular thing may worship such\\nand such a demigod. For example, a diseased person is recommended to\\nworship the sun-god; a person wantin g education may worship the goddess of\\nlearning, Sarasvaté; and a person want ing a beautiful wife may worship the\\ngoddess Umä, the wif e of Lord Çiva. In this way there are recommendations in\\nthe çästras  (Vedic scriptures) for different modes of worship of different\\ndemigods. And because a particular livi ng entity wants to enjoy a particular\\nmaterial facility, the Lord inspires him with a  strong desire to achieve that\\nbenediction from that particular demigo d, and so he successfully receives the\\nbenediction. The particular mode of the devotional attitude of the living\\nentity toward a particular type of demigod is also arranged by the Suprem e\\nLord. The demigods cannot infuse the living  entities with such an affinity, but\\nbecause He is the Supreme Lord, or the Supersoul who is present in the hearts\\nof all living entities, Kåñëa gives impetus to man to worship certain demigods.\\nThe demigods are  actually different parts of th e universal body of the Supreme\\nLord; therefore they have no independence . In the Vedic literature it is stated:\\n“The Supreme Personality of Godhead as Supersoul is also present within the\\nheart of the demigod; therefore He a rranges through the demigod to fulfill the\\ndesire of the living entity.

The\\nless intelligent living entity does not kn ow this, and therefore he foolishly goes\\nto the demigods for some benefit. But the pure devotee, when in need of\\nsomething, prays only to the Suprem e Lord. Asking for material benefit,\\nhowever, is not a sign of a pure devotee. A living entity goes to the demigods\\nusually because he is mad to fulfill his lust. This happens when something\\nundue is desired by  the living entity and the Lord Himself does not fulfill theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.desire. In the Caitanya-caritämåta  it is said that one who worships the Supreme\\nLord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictory in his\\ndesires . Devotional service to the Sup reme Lord and the worship of a demigod\\ncannot be on the same platform, because worship of a demigod is material and\\ndevotional service to the Supreme Lord is completely spiritual.\\nFor the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, material desires are\\nimpediments.

All Rights Reserved.PURPORT\\nSome commentators on the Bhagavad-gétä  say that one who worships a\\ndemigod can reach the Supreme Lord, but here it is clearly stated that the\\nworshipers of demigods go to the di fferent planetary systems where various\\ndemigods are situated, just as a worshi per of the sun achieves the sun or a\\nworshiper of the demigod of the moon achieves the moon. Similarly, if anyone\\nwants to worship a demigod like Indra, he can attain that particular god’s\\nplanet. It is not that everyone, regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped,\\nwill reach the Supreme Personality of Godh ead. That is denied here, for it is\\nclearly stated that the worshipers of de migods go to different planets in the\\nmaterial world but the devotee of the Supreme Lord goes directly to the\\nsupreme planet of  the Personality of Godhead.\\nHere the point may be raised that if the demigods are different parts of the\\nbody of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achieved by\\nworshiping them. However, worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent\\nbecause they don’t know to what part of  the body food must be supplied. Some\\nof them are so foolish that they claim that there are many parts and many ways\\nto supply food. This isn’t very sanguine. Can anyone supply food to the body\\nthrough the ears or eyes? They do not know that these demigods  are different\\nparts of the universal body of the Su preme Lord, and in their ignorance they\\nbelieve that each and every demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the\\nSupreme Lord.\\nNot only are demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary living\\nentities are also. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  it is stated that the brähmaëas  are\\nthe head of the Supreme Lord, the kñatriyas  are His arms, the vaiçyas  are His\\nwaist, the çüdras  are His leg s, and all serve different functions. Regardless of\\nthe situation, if one knows that both the demigods and himself are part and\\nparcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is perfect. But if he does not\\nunderstand this, he achieves different planets where th e demigods reside. This\\nis not the same destination the devotee reaches.\\nThe results achieved by the demigods’ benedictions are perishable because\\nwithin this material world the planets, the demigods and their worshipers areCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Therefore it is clearly stated in this verse that all results\\nachieved by worshiping dem igods are perishable, and therefore such worship is\\nperformed by the less intelligent livi ng entity. Because the pure devotee\\nengaged in Kåñëa consciousness in devotional service of the Supreme Lord\\nachieves eternal blissful existence that is full of knowl edge, his achievements\\nand those of the common worshiper of  the demigods are different. The\\nSupreme Lord is unlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited.\\nTherefore the mercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited.\\nTEXT  24\\nAVYa¢&- VYai¢-MaaPaà& MaNYaNTae MaaMabuÖYa\" )\\nPar& >aavMaJaaNaNTaae MaMaaVYaYaMaNautaMaMa( )) 24 ))\\navyaktaà vyaktim äpannaà\\nmanyante mäm abuddhayaù\\nparaà bhävam ajänanto\\nmamävyayam anuttamam\\nSYNONYMS\\navyaktam —nonmanifested; vyaktim —personality; äpannam —achieved;\\nmanyante —think; mäm —Me; abuddhayaù —less intelligent persons;\\nparam —supreme; bhävam —existence; ajänantaù —without knowing;\\nmama —My; avyayam —imperishable; anuttamam —the finest.\\nTRANSLATION\\nUnintelligent men, who do not know Me perfectly, think that I, the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa,  was impersonal before and have now\\nassumed this personality.

But those\\nwho are in the modes of passion and ig norance, the demons, the nondevotees,\\ncannot understand You. They are unable to understand You. However expert\\nsuch nondevotees may be in discussing Vedänta  and the Upaniñads  and other\\nVedic literatures, it is not possible fo r them to understand the Personality of\\nGodhead.” ( Stotra-ratna  12)\\nIn the Brahma-saàhitä  it is stated that the Personality of Godhead cannot\\nbe understood simply by study of the Vedänta  literature. Only by the mercy of\\nthe Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be known. Therefore in\\nthis verse it is clearly stat ed that not only are the worshipers of the demigods\\nless intelligent, but those nondevotees who are engaged in Vedänta  and\\nspeculation on Vedic literature without any tinge of true Kåñëa consciousness\\nare also less intelligent, and for them it is not possi ble to understand God’s\\npersonal nature. Persons who are unde r the impression that the Absolute\\nTruth is impersonal are described as abuddhayaù,  which means those who do\\nnot know the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the\\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam  it is st ated that supreme realization begins from the\\nimpersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul—but theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Modern\\nimpersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not even fol low their great\\npredecessor Çaìkaräcärya, who has spec ifically stated that Kåñëa is the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. Impers onalists, therefore, not knowing the\\nSupreme Truth, think Kåñëa to be only the son of Devaké and Vasudeva, or a\\nprince, or a power ful living entity. This is also condemned in the\\nBhagavad-gétä  (9.11). Avajänanti mäà müòhä mänuñéà tanum äçritam:  “Only\\nthe fools regard Me as an ordinary person.”\\nThe fact is that no one can understa nd Kåñëa without rendering devotional\\nservice and without developing Kåñëa consciousness. The Bhägavatam\\n(10.14.29 ) confirms this:\\nathäpi te deva padämbuja-dvaya-\\nprasäda-leçänugåhéta eva hi\\njänäti tattvaà bhagavan-mahimno\\nna cänya eko ’pi ciraà vicinvan\\n“My Lord, if one is favored by even a sl ight trace of the mercy of Your lotus\\nfeet, he can understand the greatness of Your personality. But those who\\nspeculate to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead are unable to\\nknow You, even though they conti nue to study the Vedas  for many years.” One\\ncannot understand the Supreme Personalit y of Godhead, Kåñëa, or His form,\\nquality or name simply by mental specul ation or by discussing Vedic literature.\\nOne must understand Him by devotional service. When one is  fully engaged in\\nKåñëa consciousness, beginning by chanting the mahä-mantra —Hare Kåñëa,\\nHare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma,\\nHare Hare—then only can one understand the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead. Nondevotee impersonalis ts think that Kåñëa has a body made of this\\nmaterial nature and that all His acti vities, His form and everything are mäyä.\\nThese impersonalists are known as Mäyä vädés. They do not know the ultimate\\ntruth.\\nThe twentieth verse clearly states, kämais tais tair håta-jïänäù prapadyante\\n’nya-devatäù.  “Those who are blinded by lusty desires surrender unto the\\ndifferent demigods.” It is accepted that besides the Supreme Personality ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Godhead, there are demigods wh o have their different planets, and the Lord\\nalso has a planet. As stated in the twenty-third verse, devän deva-yajo yänti\\nmad-bhaktä yänti mäm api : the worshipers of the demigods go to the different\\nplanets of the demigods, and those who are devotees of L ord Kåñëa go to the\\nKåñëaloka planet. Although this is cl early stated, the foolish impersonalists\\nstill maintain that the Lord is formle ss and that these forms are impositions.\\nFrom the study of the Gétä does it appear that the demigods and their abodes\\nare impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigods nor Kåñëa, the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead, are impersonal. They are all persons; Lord Kåñëa is\\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has His own planet, and the\\ndemigods have theirs.\\nTherefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and that\\nf o r m  i s  i m p o s e d  d o e s  n o t  h o l d  t r u e .  I t  is clearly stated here that it is not\\nimposed. From the Bhagavad-gétä  we can clearly understand that the forms of\\nthe demigods and the form of  the Supreme Lord are simultaneously existing\\nand that Lord Kåñëa is sac-cid-änanda,  eternal blissful knowledge. The Vedas\\nalso confirm that the Supreme Absolute Truth is änanda-mayo ’bhyäsät,  or by\\nnature full of blissful pleasure, and that He is the rese rvoir of unlimited\\nauspicious qualities. And in the Gétä the Lord says that although He is aja\\n(unborn), He still appears. These are th e facts that we should understand from\\nthe Bhagavad-gétä.  We cannot understand how the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead can  be impersonal; the imposition th eory of the impersonalist monist\\nis false as far as the statements of the Gétä are concerned.

If\\nKåñëa, the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, were mäyä,  material,\\nas the impersonalists consider Him to be , then like the living entity He would\\nchange His body and forget e verything about His past life. Anyone with a\\nmaterial body cannot remember his past li fe, nor can he foretell his future life,\\nnor can he predict the outcome of his present life; therefore he cannot know\\nwhat is happening in past, present and future. Unles s one is liberated from\\nmaterial contamination, he cannot know past, present and future.\\nUnlike the ordinary human being, Lord Kåñëa clearly says that He\\ncompletely knows what happened in th e past, what is happening in the\\npresent, and what will happen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter we have\\nseen that Lord Kåñëa remembers instructing Viva svän, the sun-god, millions of\\nyears ago. Kåñëa knows every living entity because He is situated in every\\nliving being’s heart as the Supersoul. But despite His presence in every living\\nentity as Supersoul and His presence  as the Supreme Personality of God head,\\nthe less intelligent, even if able to realize the impersonal Brahman, cannot\\nrealize Çré Kåñëa as the Supreme Person . Certainly the transcendental body of\\nÇré Kåñëa is not perishable. He is just like the sun, and mäyä  is like a cloud. In\\nthe material  world we can see that there is the sun and that there are cloudsCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.and different stars and planets. The cl ouds may cover all these in the sky\\ntemporarily, but this covering is only apparent to our limited vision. The sun,\\nmoon and stars are not actually cov ered. Similarly, mäyä  cannot cover the\\nSupreme Lord. By His internal potenc y He is not manifest to the less\\nintelligent class of men. As it is stated in the third verse of this chapter , out of\\nmillions and millions of men, some  try to become perfect in thi s human form\\nof life, and out of thousands and thousa nds of such perfected men, hardly one\\ncan understand what Lord Kåñëa is.

By gradual development of Kåñëa consciousness in good association,\\nthe living entity can understand that due to forgetfulness of Kåñëa he has\\nbecome conditioned by the laws of material nature.

However, he who is actually elevated in\\nKåñëa consciousness does not care for the different processes. He simply\\ndirectly engages himself in activities  of Kåñëa consciousness and thereby\\nfactually attains his constitutional position as an eternal servitor of Lord\\nKåñëa. In such a situation he takes pleasure in hearing and glorifying the\\nSupreme Lord in pure devotional service.  He is convinced that by his doing so,\\nall his objectives will be fulfilled. This determined faith is called dåòha-vrata,\\nand it is t he beginning of bhakti-yoga,  or transcendental loving service. That is\\nthe verdict of all scriptures.

But beyond Brahman there is Parabrahman. Brahman\\nrefers to the living entity, and Parabrahman refers to the Supreme Personality\\nof Godhead. The constitutiona l position of the living entity is different from\\nthe position he takes in the material world. In material consciousness his\\nnature is to try to be the lord of ma tter, but in spiritual consciousness, Kåñëa\\nconsciousness, his position is to serve the Suprem e. When the living entity is\\nin material consciousness, he has to take on various bodies in the material\\nworld. That is called karma,  or varied creation by the force of material\\nconsciousness.\\nIn Vedic literature the living entity is called jévätmä  and Brahman, but he is\\nnever called Parabrahman. The living entity ( jévätmä ) takes different\\npositions—sometimes he merges into th e dark material nature and identifies\\nhimself with matter, and sometim es he identifies himself with the superior,\\nspiritual nature. Therefore he is calle d the Supreme Lord’s marginal energy.\\nAccording to his identification with mate rial or spiritual nature, he receives aCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.material or spiritual body. In material nature he may take a body from any of\\nthe 8,400,000 species of life, but in spir itual nature he has only one body. In\\nmaterial nature he is manifested some times as a man, demigod, animal, beast,\\nbird, etc., according to his karma.  To attain material heavenly planets and\\nenjoy their facilities, he sometimes performs sacrifices ( yajïa ), but when his\\nmerit is exhausted he returns to earth ag ain in the form of a man. This process\\nis called karma.\\nThe Chändogya Upaniñad  describes the Vedic sacrificial process. On the\\nsacrificial altar, five kinds of offerings ar e made into five kinds of fire. The five\\nkinds of fire are conceived of as the he avenly planets, clouds, the earth, man\\nand woman, and the f ive kinds of sacrificial offerings are faith, the enjoyer on\\nthe moon, rain, grains and semen.\\nIn the process of sacrifice, the living  entity makes specific sacrifices to\\nattain specific heavenly planets and consequently reaches them. When the\\nmerit of sacrifice is exhausted, the livi ng entity descends to earth in the form\\nof rain, then takes on the  form of grains, and the grains are eaten by man and\\ntransformed into semen, which impregnates a woman, and thus the living\\nentity once again attains the human fo rm to perform sacrifice and so repeat\\nthe same cycle. In this way, the living entity perpetual ly comes and goes on the\\nmaterial path. The Kåñëa conscious pers on, however, avoids such sacrifices. He\\ntakes directly to Kåñëa consciousness and thereby prepares himself to return to\\nGodhead.\\nImpersonalist commentators on the Bhagavad-gétä  unreasonably assume\\nthat Brahman takes the form of jéva in the material world, and to substantiate\\nthis they refer to Chapter Fifteen, verse 7,  of the Gétä.  But in this verse the\\nLord also speaks of the livin g entity as “an eternal fragment of Myself.” The\\nfragment of God, the living entity, may fall down into the material world, but\\nthe Supreme Lord (Acyuta) never falls down. Therefore this assumption that\\nthe Supreme Brahman assumes the form of jéva is not a cceptable. It is\\nimportant to remember that in Vedic li terature Brahman (the living entity) is\\ndistinguished from Parabrahman (the Supreme Lord).\\nTEXT  4Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

A person who at the end of his life quits his body thinking of\\nKåñëa attains the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord, but it is not true\\nthat a person who thinks of something other than Kåñëa attains the same\\ntranscendental state. This is a point we should note very carefully. How can\\none die in the proper state of mind? Mahäräja Bharata, although a great\\npersonality, thought of a deer at the end of his life, and s o in his next life he\\nwas transferred into the body of a deer. Although as a deer he remembered his\\npast activities, he had to accept that  animal body. Of course, one’s thoughts\\nduring the course of one’s life accumula te to influence one’s thoughts at the\\nmoment of death, so this life creates one’ s next life. If in one’s present life one\\nlives in the mode of goodness and always thinks of Kåñëa, it is possible for one\\nto remember Kåñëa at the end of one’s li fe. That will help one be transferred to\\nthe transc endental nature of Kåñëa. If one is transcendentally absorbed in\\nKåñëa’s service, then his next body wi ll be transcendental (spiritual), not\\nmaterial. Therefore the chanting of Ha re Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa,\\nHare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma , Hare Hare is the best process\\nfor successfully changing one’s state of being at the end of one’s life.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

He is luminous\\nlike the sun, and He is transcende ntal, beyond this material nature.\\nPURPORT\\nThe process of thinking of the Suprem e is mentioned in this verse. The\\nforemost point is that He is not impe rsonal or void. One cannot meditate on\\nsomething impersonal or void. That is ve ry difficult. The process of thinking of\\nKåñëa, however, is very easy  and is factually stated herein. First of all, the Lord\\nis puruña,  a person—we think of the person Räma and the person Kåñëa. And\\nwhether one thinks of Räma or of Kåñëa, what He is like is described in this\\nverse of Bhagavad-gétä.  The Lord is kavi;  that is , He knows past, present and\\nfuture and therefore knows everything.  He is the oldest personality because He\\nis the origin of everything; everything i s  b o r n  o u t  o f  H i m .  H e  i s  a l s o  t h e\\nsupreme controller of the universe, an d He is the maintainer and instruct or of\\nhumanity. He is smaller than the sm allest. The living entity is one\\nten-thousandth part of the tip of a hai r, but the Lord is so inconceivably small\\nthat He enters into the heart of this particle. Therefore He is called smaller\\nthan the smallest. As the Supreme, He can enter into the atom and into the\\nheart of the smallest and control him as  the Supersoul. Although so small, He\\nis still all-pervading and is maintaining everything. By Him all these planetary\\nsystems are sustained. We often wonder how t hese big planets are floating in\\nthe air. It is stated here that the Supr eme Lord, by His inconceivable energy, is\\nsustaining all these big planets and systems of galaxies. The word acintya\\n(“inconceivable”) is very signific ant in this connection. God’s en ergy is\\nbeyond our conception, beyond our thinking jurisdiction, and is thereforeCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.called inconceivable ( acintya ). Who can argue this point? He pervades this\\nmaterial world and yet is beyond it. We  cannot comprehend even this material\\nworld, which is insign ificant compared to the spiritual world—so how can we\\ncomprehend what is beyond? Acintya  means that which is beyond this material\\nworld, that which our argument, logi c and philosophical speculation cannot\\ntouch, that which is inconceivable. Therefore intel ligent persons, avoiding\\nuseless argument and speculation, should  accept what is stated in scriptures\\nlike the Vedas, Bhagavad-gétä  and Çrémad-Bhägavatam  and follow the\\nprinciples they set down. This will lead one to understanding.\\nTEXT  10\\nPa[Yaa<ak-ale/ MaNaSaacle/Na\\n >a¢-ya Yau¢-ae YaaeGable/Na cEv )\\n>a]uvaeMaRDYae Pa[a<aMaaveXYa SaMYa‚\\n KSa Ta& Par& PauåzMauPaEiTa idVYaMa( )) 10 ))\\nprayäëa-käle manasäcalena\\nbhaktyä yukto yoga-balena caiva\\nbhruvor madhye präëam äveçya samyak\\nsa taà paraà puruñam upaiti divyam\\nSYNONYMS\\nprayäëa-käle —at the time of death; manasä —by the mind; acalena —without\\nits being deviated; bhaktyä —in full devotion; yuktaù —engaged;\\nyoga-balena —by the power of mystic yoga;  ca—also; eva—certainly;\\nbhruvoù —the two eyebrows; madhye —between; präëam —the life air;\\näveçya —establishing; samyak —completely; saù—he; tam—that;\\nparam —transcendental; puruñam —Personality of Godhead; upaiti —achieves;\\ndivyam —in the spiritual kingdom.\\nTRANSLATIONCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Taking it for granted\\nthat Arjuna might not know how to practice ñaö-cakra-yoga,  the Lord explains\\nthe process in the followi ng verses. The Lord says that Brahman, although one\\nwithout a second, has various manifestat ions and features.

The social construction of the world has\\nchanged so much that there is no possibility of one’s pra cticing celibacy from\\nthe beginning of student life.

Previous verses have mentioned four different kinds of\\ndevotees—the distressed, the inquisitive, those who  seek material gain, and\\nthe speculative philosophers. Different processes of liberation have also been\\ndescribed: karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga  and haöha-yoga.  The principles of these yoga\\nsystems have some bhakti  added, but this verse particularly mentions pure\\nbhakti-yoga,  without any mixture of jïäna, karma  or haöha.  As indicated by the\\nword ananya-cetäù,  in pure bhakti-yoga  the devotee desires nothing but Kåñëa.\\nA pure devotee does not desire promot ion to heavenly planets, nor does he\\nseek oneness with the brahmajyoti  or salvation or liberation from material\\nentanglement. A pure devotee does not desire anything. In the\\nCaitanya-caritämåta  the pure devotee is called niñkäma,  which means he has\\nno desire for self-interest. Perfec t peace belongs to him alone, not  to them who\\nstrive for personal gain. Whereas a jïäna-yogé, karma-yogé  or haöha-yogé  has his\\nown selfish interests, a perfect devotee ha s no desire other than to please the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. Therefor e the Lord says that for anyone who\\nis unf linchingly devoted to Him, He is easy to attain.\\nA pure devotee always engages in devoti onal service to Kåñëa in one of His\\nvarious personal features. Kåñëa has various plenary expansions and\\nincarnations, such as Räma and Nåsiàh a, and a devotee can choose to fix his\\nmind in loving service to any of thes e transcendental forms of the Supreme\\nLord. Such a devotee meets with none  of the problems that plague the\\npractitioners of other yogas.  Bhakti-yoga  is very simple and pure and easy to\\nperform. One can begin simply by chanting Hare Kåñëa. The Lord is merci fulCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.to all, but as we have already explained, He is especially inclined toward those\\nwho always serve Him without deviatio n. The Lord helps such devotees in\\nvarious ways. As stated in the Vedas  (Kaöha Upaniñad  1.2.23 ), yam evaiña våëute\\ntena labhyas/ tasya iña ätmä vivåëute tanuà sväm:  one who is fully surrendered\\nand engaged in the devotional servic e of the Supreme Lord can understand\\nthe Supreme Lord as He is. And as stated in Bhagavad-gétä  (10.10 ), dadämi\\nbuddhi-yogaà tam:  the Lord gives such a devotee su fficient intelligence so that\\nultimately the devotee can attain Him in His spiritual kingdom.\\nThe special qualification of the pure devo tee is that he is always thinking of\\nKåñëa without deviation and without considering the time or place. There\\nshould be no impediments. He should be  able to carry out his service anywhere\\nand at any time. Some say that the devotee should remain in holy places like\\nVåndävana or some holy town where th e Lord lived, but a pure devotee can\\nlive anywhere and create the atmosp here of Våndävana by his devotional\\nservice. It was Çré Advaita who told Lord Caitanya, “Wherever  You are, O\\nLord— there  is Våndävana.”\\nAs indicated by the words satatam  and nityaçaù,  which mean “always,”\\n“regularly,” or “every day,” a pure devotee constantly remembers Kåñëa and\\nmeditates upon Him. These are qualifications of the pure devotee for whom\\nthe Lord is most easily attainable. Bhakti-yoga  is the system that the Gétä\\nrecommends above all others. Generally, the bhakti-yogés  are engaged in five\\ndifferent ways: (1) çänta-bhakta,  engaged in devotional service in neutrality;\\n(2) däsya-bhakta,  engaged in devotional service as servant; (3 ) säkhya-bhakta,\\nengaged as friend; (4) vätsalya-bhakta,  engaged as parent; and (5)\\nmädhurya-bhakta,  engaged as conjugal lover of the Supreme Lord. In any of\\nthese ways, the pure devotee is always constantly engaged in the\\ntranscendental loving service of the Supreme Lord and cannot forget the\\nSupreme Lord, and so for him the Lord is easily attained. A pure devotee\\ncannot forget the Supreme Lord for a moment, and similarly the Supreme Lord\\ncannot forget His pure devotee for a moment. This is the great bless ing of the\\nKåñëa conscious process of chanting the mahä-mantra —Hare Kåñëa, Hare\\nKåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare\\nHare.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

And such also is the duration of his night.\\nPURPORT\\nThe duration of the material universe is limited. It is manifested in cycles of\\nkalpas.  A kalpa  is a day of Brahmä, and one day of Brahmä consists of a\\nthousand cycles of four yugas,  or ages: Satya, Tretä, Dväpara and Kali. The\\ncycle of Satya is characteri zed by virtue, wisdom and religion, there being\\npractically no ignorance and vice, and the yuga  lasts 1,728,000 years. In the\\nTretä-yuga vice is introduced, and this yuga  lasts 1,296,000 years. In the\\nDväpara-yuga there is an even greater decline in virtue  and religion, vice\\nincreasing, and this yuga  lasts 864,000 years. And finally in Kali-yuga (the\\nyuga  we have now been experiencing ov er the past 5,000 years) there is an\\nabundance of strife, ignorance, irreligion  and vice, true virtue being practically\\nnonexistent, and this yuga  lasts 432,000 years. In Kali-yuga vice increases to\\nsuch a point that at the termination of the yuga  the Supreme Lord Himself\\nappears as the Kalki avatära,  vanquishes the demons, saves His devotees, and\\ncommences another Satya-yuga . Then the process is set rolling again. These\\nfour yugas,  rotating a thousand times, comp rise one day of Brahmä, and the\\nsame number comprise one night. Brahmä lives one hundred of such “years”\\nand then dies. These “hundred years” by earth calculations to tal to 311 trillion\\nand 40 billion earth years. By these ca lculations the life of Brahmä seems\\nfantastic and interminable, but from the view point of eternity it is as brief as a\\nlightning flash. In the Causal Ocean there are innumerable Brahmäs rising\\nand disappearing like bubbles in the Atlantic. Brahmä and his creation are allCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Brahmä, however, is directly engaged in the service\\nof the Supreme Lord in the management  of this universe—therefore he at\\nonce attains liberation. Elev ated sannyäsés  are promoted to Brahmä’s particular\\nplanet, Brahmaloka, which is the highest planet in the material universe and\\nwhich survives all the heavenly planets in the upper strata of the planetary\\nsystem, but in due course Brahmä and all the inhabi tants of Brahmaloka are\\nsubject to death, according to the law of material nature.\\nTEXT  18\\nAVYa¢-aÜy¢-Ya\" SavaR\" Pa[>avNTYahraGaMae )\\nra}YaaGaMae Pa[l/IYaNTae Ta}aEvaVYa¢-Sa&jke- )) 18 ))\\navyaktäd vyaktayaù sarväù\\nprabhavanty ahar-ägame\\nrätry-ägame praléyante\\ntatraivävyakta-saàjïake\\nSYNONYMS\\navyaktät —from the unmanifest; vyaktayaù —living entities; sarväù —all;\\nprabhavanti —become manifest; ahaù-ägame —at the beginning of the day;\\nrätri-ägame —at the fall of night; praléyante —are annihilated; tatra —into that;\\neva—certainly; avyakta —the unmanifest; saàjïake —which is called.\\nTRANSLATION\\nAt the beginning of Brahmä’s day, all living entities become manifest from\\nthe unmanifest state, and thereafter, wh en the night falls, they are merged into\\nthe unmanifest again.\\nTEXT  19Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

There  are also trees, called “desire trees,” that\\nsupply any type of eatable upon de mand, and there are cows, known as surabhi\\ncows, which supply a limitless supply of mi lk. In this abode, the Lord is served\\nby hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune (Lak ñmés), and He is called\\nGovinda, the primal Lord and the cause of all causes. The Lord is accustomed\\nto blow His flute ( veëuà kvaëantam ). His transcendental form is the most\\nattractive in all the worlds—His eyes ar e like lotus petals, and the color of His\\nbody is like the color of clouds. He is so attractive that His beauty excels that\\nof thousands of Cupids. He wears saffron cloth, a garland around His neck and\\na peacock feather in His hair. In the Bhagavad-gétä  Lord Kåñëa gives only a\\nsmall hint of His pe rsonal abode, Goloka Våndävana, which is the supermost\\nplanet in the spiritual kingdom. A vivid description is given in the\\nBrahma-saàhitä.  Vedic literatures ( Kaöha Upaniñad  1.3.11 ) state that there is\\nnothing superior to the abode of the Supreme Godhead, and that that abode is\\nthe ultimate destination ( puruñän na paraà kiïcit sä käñöhä paramä gatiù ).\\nWhen one attains to it, he never returns to the material world.

Although He is present in His abode, He is\\nall-pervading, and everything is situated within Him.\\nPURPORT\\nIt is here clearly stated that the supr eme destination, from which there is no\\nreturn, is the abode of Kåñëa, the Supreme Person. The Brahma-saàhitä\\ndescribes this supreme abode as änanda-cinmaya-rasa , a place where\\neverything is full of spiritual bliss. A ll the variegatedness manifest there is of\\nthe quality of spiritual bliss—nothing th ere is material. That variegatedness is\\nexpanded as the spiritual expansion of  the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the\\nmanifestation there is totally of the spiritual energy, as explained in Chapter\\nSeven. As far as this material world is concerned, although the Lord is always\\nin His supreme abode, He is nonethele ss all-pervading by His material energy.\\nSo by His spiritual and material ener gies He is present everywhere—both in\\nthe material and in the spiritual universes. Yasyäntaù-sthäni  means that\\neverything is sustained within Him, wi thin either His spiritual or material\\nenergy. The Lord is all-pervading by these two energies.\\nTo enter Kåñëa’s supreme abode or the innumerable Vaikuëöha planets is\\npossible only by bhakti,  devotional service, as clearly indicated here by the\\nword bhaktyä.  No other process can help one attain that supreme abode. TheCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Vedas  (Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad  3.2) also describe the supreme abode and the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. Eko vaçé sarva-gaù kåñëaù.  In that abode\\nthere is only one Supreme Personality of  Godhead, whose name is Kåñëa. He is\\nthe supreme merciful Deity, and although situated there as one He has\\nexpanded Himself into millions and millions of plenary expansions. The Vedas\\ncompare the Lord to a tree standing sti ll yet bearing many varieties of fruits,\\nflowers and changing leaves. The plenar y expansions of the Lord who preside\\nover the Vaikuëö ha planets are four-armed, and they are known by a variety of\\nnames—Puruñottama, Trivikrama, Keçava, Mädhava, Aniruddha, Håñékeça,\\nSaìkarñaëa, Pradyumna, Çrédhara, Väsudeva, Dämodara, Janärdana,\\nNäräyaëa, Vämana, Padmanäbha, etc.\\nThe Brahma-saàhitä  (5.37) also confirms that although the Lord is always\\nin the supreme abode, Goloka Våndävana, He is all-pervading, so that\\neverything is going on nicely ( goloka eva nivasaty akhilätma-bhütaù ).

A devotee\\nof the Supreme Lord should not worry whether he will depart by arrangement\\nor by accident. The devotee should be firmly established in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness and chant Hare Kåñëa. He should know that concern over\\neither of these two paths is troublesome.  The best way to be absorbed in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness is to be always dovetailed  in His service, and this will make o ne’s\\npath to the spiritual kingdom sa fe, certain and direct.

All Rights Reserved.particularly deal with Kåñëa consciousn ess and devotional service. One has to\\nstudy the Vedas  under the guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many\\nausterities and penances while l iving under his care. A brahmacäré  has to live\\nin the home of the spiritual master just  like a servant, and he must beg alms\\nfrom door to door and bring them to the spiritual master. He takes food only\\nunder the master’s order, and if the master neglects t o call the student for food\\nthat day, the student fasts. These ar e some of the Vedic principles for\\nobserving brahmacarya.\\nAfter the student studies the Vedas  under the master for a period from five\\nto twenty years, he may become a ma n of perfect character. Study of the Vedas\\nis not meant for the recreation of armc hair speculators, but for the formation\\nof character. After thi s training, the brahmacäré  is allowed to enter into\\nhousehold life and marry. When he is a householder, he has to perform many\\nsacrifices so that he may achieve furt her enlightenment. He must also give\\ncharity according to the country, time and candidate, discriminating among\\ncharity in goodness, in passion and in ignorance, as described in Bhagavad-gétä.\\nThen after retiring from household life, upon accepting the order of\\nvänaprastha,  he undergoes severe penances—living in forests, dressing with\\ntree bark,  not shaving, etc. By carrying out the orders of brahmacarya,\\nhouseholder life, vänaprastha  and finally sannyäsa,  one becomes elevated to\\nthe perfectional stage of life. Some  are then elevated to the heavenly\\nkingdoms, and when they become even more advanc ed they are liberated in\\nthe spiritual sky, either in the impersonal brahmajyoti  or in the Vaikuëöha\\nplanets or Kåñëaloka. This is the path outlined by Vedic literatures.\\nThe beauty of Kåñëa consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by\\nengaging in devotional service, one can surpass all the rituals of the different\\norders of life.\\nThe words idaà viditvä  indicate that one should understand the\\ninstructions given by Çré Kåñëa in th is chapter and the Seventh Chapter of\\nBhagavad-gétä.  One should try to understand these chapters not by scholarship\\nor mental speculation but by hearing the m in association with devotees.\\nChapters Seven through Twelve are the essence of Bhagavad-gétä.  The first six\\nand the last six chapters are like cove rings for the middle six chapters, whichCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

If one is fortunate enough t o understand\\nBhagavad-gétä —especially these middle six chapters—in the association of\\ndevotees, then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all penances,\\nsacrifices, charities, speculations, etc ., for one can achieve all the results of\\nthese activities simply by Kåñëa consciousness.\\nOne who has a little faith in Bhagavad-gétä  should learn Bhagavad-gétä  from\\na devotee, because in the beginning of th e Fourth Chapter it is stated clearly\\nthat Bhagavad-gétä  can be understood only by devotees; no one else can\\nperfectly understand the purpo se of Bhagavad-gétä.  One should therefore learn\\nBhagavad-gétä  from a devotee of Kåñëa, not from mental speculators. This is a\\nsign of faith. When one searches for a devotee and finally gets a devotee’s\\nassociation one actually begins to study and understan d Bhagavad-gétä.  By\\nadvancement in the association of the devotee one is placed in devotional\\nservice, and this service dispels all one’ s misgivings about Kåñëa, or God, and\\nKåñëa’s activities, form, pastimes, name and other features. After these\\nmisgiving s have been perfectly cleared away, one becomes fixed in one’s study.\\nThen one relishes the study of Bhagavad-gétä  and attains the state of feeling\\nalways Kåñëa conscious. In the advanced stage, one falls completely in love\\nwith Kåñëa. This highest perfect ional stage of life enables the devotee to be\\ntransferred to Kåñëa’s abode in the spir itual sky, Goloka Våndävana, where the\\ndevotee becomes eternally happy.\\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighth Chapter of the Çrémad\\nBhagavad-gétä  in the matter of Attaining the Supreme.\\n- CHAPTER 9 -\\nThe Most Confidential KnowledgeCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

This hearing process is recommended in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam:\\n“The messages of the Supreme Personal ity of Godhead are full of potencies,\\nand these potencies can be realized if  topics regarding the Supreme GodheadCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.are discussed amongst devotees. This ca nnot be achieved by the association of\\nmental speculators or academic scholars, for it is realized knowledge.”\\nThe devotees are constantly engaged in the Supreme Lord’s service. The\\nLord understands the mentality and sincer ity of a particular living entity who\\nis engaged in Kåñëa consciousne ss and gives him the intelligence to\\nunderstand the science of Kåñëa in the  association of devotees. Discussion of\\nKåñëa is very potent, and if a fortunate person has such association and tries to\\nassimilate the knowledge, then he will surely make advancement toward\\nspiritual realization. Lord Kåñëa, in order to encourage Arjuna to higher and\\nhigher elevation in His potent service,  describes in this Ninth Chapter matters\\nmore confidential than any He has already disclosed.\\nThe very beginning of Bhagavad-gétä,  the First Chapter, is more or less an\\nintroduction to the rest of the book; and in the Second and Third chapters,\\nthe spiritual knowledge described is calle d confidential. Topics discussed in the\\nSeventh and Eighth chap ters are specifically related to devotional service, and\\nbecause they bring enlightenment in Kåñëa consciousness, they are called\\nmore confidential. But the matters whic h are described in the Ninth Chapter\\ndeal with unalloyed, pure devotion. Therefore this  is called the most\\nconfidential. One who is situated in th e most confidential knowledge of Kåñëa\\nis naturally transcendental; he therefore has no material pangs, although he is\\nin the material world. In the Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  it is said that although\\none who has a sincere desire to render loving service to the Supreme Lord is\\nsituated in the conditional state of material existence, he is to be considered\\nliberated. Similarly, we shall find in the Bhagavad-gétä,  Tenth Chapter, that\\nanyone who is engaged  in that way is a liberated person.\\nNow this first verse has specific significance. The words idaà jïänam  (“this\\nknowledge”) refer to pure devotional service, which consists of nine different\\nactivities: hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying,\\nobeying, maintaining frien dship and surrendering everything. By the practice\\nof these nine elements of devotional service one is elevated to spiritual\\nconsciousness, Kåñëa consciousness. When one’s heart is thus cleared of\\nmaterial contamination, one can understand this science of Kåñëa. Simply to\\nunderstand that a living entity is not material is not sufficient. That may beCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.the beginning of spiritual realization, but one should recognize the difference\\nbetween activities of the body and the spiritual activities of one who\\nunderstan ds that he is not the body.\\nIn the Seventh Chapter we have alre ady discussed the opulent potency of\\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hi s different energies, the inferior and\\nsuperior natures, and all this material manifestation. Now in Chapter Nine the\\nglories of the Lord will be delineated.\\nThe Sanskrit word anasüyave  in this verse is also very significant. Generally\\nthe commentators, even if they are high ly scholarly, are all envious of Kåñëa,\\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even the most erudite scholars write on\\nBhagavad-gétä  very inac curately. Because they are envious of Kåñëa, their\\ncommentaries are useless. The commentarie s given by devotees of the Lord are\\nbona fide. No one can explain Bhagavad-gétä  or give perfect knowledge of\\nKåñëa if he is envious. One who criticizes the characte r of Kåñëa without\\nknowing Him is a fool. So such commentaries should be very carefully avoided.\\nFor one who understands that Kåñëa is  the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\\nthe pure and transcendental Personality, these chapters will be very beneficial.\\nTEXT  2\\nraJaivÛa raJaGauù& Paiv}aiMadMautaMaMa( )\\nPa[TYa+aavGaMa& DaMYa| SauSau%& k-TauRMaVYaYaMa( )) 2 ))\\nräja-vidyä räja-guhyaà\\npavitram idam uttamam\\npratyakñävagamaà dharmyaà\\nsu-sukhaà kartum avyayam\\nSYNONYMS\\nräja-vidyä —the king of education; räja-guhyam —the king of confidential\\nknowledge; pavitram —the purest; idam —this; uttamam —transcendental;\\npratyakña —by direct experience; avagamam —understood; dharmyam —theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

It is\\nthe purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by\\nrealization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully\\nperformed.\\nPURPORT\\nThis chapter of Bhagavad-gétä  is called the king of education because it is\\nthe essence of all doctrines and phil osophies explained before. Among the\\nprincipal philosophers in India are Gautama, Kaëäda, Kapila, Yäjïavalkya,\\nÇäëòilya and Vaiçvänara. And fin ally there is Vyäsadeva, the author of the\\nVedänta-sütra.  So there is no dearth of knowledge in the field of philosophy or\\ntranscendental knowledge. Now the Lord says that this Ninth Chapter is the\\nking of all such knowledge, the essence of all knowledge t hat can be derived\\nfrom the study of the Vedas  and different kinds of philosophy. It is the most\\nconfidential because confidential or  transcendental knowledge involves\\nunderstanding the difference between the soul and the body. And the king of\\nall confiden tial knowledge culminates in devotional service.\\nGenerally, people are not educated in this confidential knowledge; they are\\neducated in external knowledge. As fa r as ordinary education is concerned,\\npeople are involved with so many departments: politics, sociology, physics,\\nchemistry, mathematics, astro nomy, engineering, etc. There are so many\\ndepartments of knowledge all over the world and many huge universities, but\\nthere is, unfortunately, no university  or educational institution where the\\nscience of the spirit soul is instructed. Yet the soul is the most important part\\nof the body; without the presence of th e soul, the body has no value. Still\\npeople are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life, not caring for\\nthe vital soul.\\nThe Bhagavad-gétä,  especially from the Second Chapter on, stresses theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.importance of the soul. In the very begi nning, the Lord says that this body is\\nperishable and that the soul is not perishable ( antavanta ime dehä nityasyoktäù\\nçarériëaù ). That is a conf idential part of knowledge:  simply knowing that the\\nspirit soul is different from this body and that its nature is immutable,\\nindestructible and eternal. But that gi ves no positive information about the\\nsoul. Sometimes people are under the impression that the soul is different from\\nthe body and that when the body is fini shed, or one is liberated from the body,\\nthe soul remains in a void and becomes im personal. But actually that is not the\\nfact. How can the soul, which is so active within this body, be inact ive after\\nbeing liberated from the body? It is always  active. If it is eternal, then it is\\neternally active, and its activities in the spiritual kingdom are the most\\nconfidential part of spiritual knowledge. These activities of the spirit soul are\\ntherefor e indicated here as constituting the king of all knowledge, the most\\nconfidential part of all knowledge.\\nThis knowledge is the purest form of  all activities, as explained in Vedic\\nliterature. In the Padma Puräëa,  man’s sinful activities have been analyzed and\\nare shown to be the results of sin afte r sin. Those who are engaged in fruitive\\nactivities are entang led in different stages and forms of sinful reactions. For\\ninstance, when the seed of a particular  tree is sown, the tree does not appear\\nimmediately to grow; it takes some time. It  is first a small, sprouting plant, then\\nit assumes the form of a tree, the n it flowers and bears fruit, and, when it is\\ncomplete, the flowers and fruits are en joyed by persons who have sown the\\nseed of the tree. Similarly, a man performs  a sinful act, and like a seed it takes\\ntime to fructify. There are different stages. The sin ful action may have already\\nstopped within the individual, but the resu lts or the fruit of that sinful action\\nare still to be enjoyed. There are sins wh ich are still in the form of a seed, and\\nthere are others which are already fructified and are giving us  fruit, which we\\nare enjoying as distress and pain.\\nAs explained in the twenty-eighth verse of the Seventh Chapter , a person\\nwho has completely ended the reactions of  all sinful activities and who is fully\\nengaged in pious activities, being freed from the duality of this material world,\\nbecomes engaged in d evotional service to the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead, Kåñëa. In other words, th ose who are actually engaged in theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.devotional service of the Supreme Lord  are already freed from all reactions.\\nThis statement is confirmed in the Padma Puräëa:\\naprärabdha-phalaà päpaà\\nküöaà béjaà phalonmukham\\nkrameëaiva praléyeta\\nviñëu-bhakti-ratätmanäm\\nFor those who are engaged in the de votional service of the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead, all sinful reacti ons, whether fructified, in the stock, or\\nin the form of a seed, gradually vani sh. Therefore the purifying potency of\\ndevotional service is very str ong, and it is called pavitram uttamam,  the purest.\\nUttama  means transcendental. Tamas  means this material world or darkness,\\nand uttama  means that which is transcende ntal to material activities.\\nDevotional activities are never to be considered material, a lthough sometimes\\nit appears that devotees are engaged ju st like ordinary men. One who can see\\nand is familiar with devotional service will know that they are not material\\nactivities. They are all spiritual an d devotional, uncontaminated by the\\nmaterial mo des of nature.\\nIt is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can\\nperceive the results directly. This direct  result is actually perceived, and we\\nhave practical experience that any pers on who is chanting the holy names of\\nKåñëa (Hare Kåñëa, Ha re Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare\\nRäma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare) in course of chanting without offenses feels\\nsome transcendental pleasure and very quickly becomes purified of all material\\ncontamination. This is actually seen. Furthermore, if one engages not only in\\nhearing but in trying to broadcast the message of devotional activities as well,\\nor if he engages himself in helpin g the missionary activities of Kåñëa\\nconsciousness, he gradually feels spiritual progress. This advancement in\\nspirit ual life does not depend on an y kind of previous education or\\nqualification. The method itself is so pu re that by simply engaging in it one\\nbecomes pure.\\nIn the Vedänta-sütra  (3.2.26 ) this is also described in the following words:\\nprakäçaç ca karmaëy abhyäsät.  “Devotional service is so potent that simply byCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.engaging in the activities of devoti onal service one becomes enlightened\\nwithout a doubt.” A practica l example of this can be seen in the previous life\\nof Närada, who in that life happened to  be the son of a maidservant. He had\\nno education, nor was he born into a high family. But when his mother was\\nengaged in serving great devotees, Närada also became e ngaged, and\\nsometimes, in the absence of his mother, he would serve the great devotees\\nhimself. Närada personally says,\\nucchiñöa-lepän anumodito dvijaiù\\nsakåt sma bhuïje tad-apästa-kilbiñaù\\nevaà pravåttasya viçuddha-cetasas\\ntad-dharma evätma-ruciù prajäyate\\nIn this verse from Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.5.25 ) Närada describes his previous\\nlife to his disciple Vyäsadeva. He says  that while engaged as a boy servant for\\nthose purified devotees during the four months of their stay, he was intimately\\nassociating with the m. Sometimes those sages left remnants of food on their\\ndishes, and the boy, who would wash their dishes, wanted to taste the\\nremnants. So he asked the great devotees for their permission, and when they\\ngave it Närada ate those remnants and consequently be came freed from all\\nsinful reactions. As he went on eating , he gradually became as pure-hearted as\\nthe sages. The great devotees relished th e taste of unceasing devotional service\\nto the Lord by hearing and chanting, and Närada gradually developed the\\nsame  taste. Närada says further,\\ntatränvahaà kåñëa-kathäù pragäyatäm\\nanugraheëäçåëavaà manoharäù\\ntäù çraddhayä me ’nupadaà viçåëvataù\\npriyaçravasy aìga mamäbhavad ruciù\\nBy associating with the sages, Närada got the taste for hearing and chanting\\nthe glories of the Lord, and he developed a great desire for devotional service.\\nTherefore, as described in the Vedänta-sütra,  prakäçaç ca karmaëy abhyäsät:  if\\none is engaged simp ly in the acts of devotional service, everything is revealed\\nto him automatically, and he can understand. This is called pratyakña,  directlyCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.perceived.\\nThe word dharmyam  means “the path of religion.” Närada was actually a\\nson of a maidservant. He had no opport unity to go to school. He was simply\\nassisting his mother, and fortunately his mother rendered some service to the\\ndevotees. The child Närada also g ot the opportunity and simply by association\\nachieved the highest goal of all religi on. The highest goal of all religion is\\ndevotional service, as stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (sa vai puàsäà paro\\ndharmo yato bhaktir adhokñaje ). Religious people generally do  not know that\\nthe highest perfection of religion is th e attainment of devotional service. As\\nwe have already discussed in regard to the last verse of Chapter Eight ( vedeñu\\nyajïeñu tapaùsu caiva ), generally Vedic knowledge is required for\\nself-realization.  But here, although Närada never went to the school of the\\nspiritual master and was not educated in  the Vedic principles, he acquired the\\nhighest results of Vedic study. This pr ocess is so potent that even without\\nperforming the religious process regularly , one can be raised to the highest\\nperfection. How is this possible? This is also confirmed in Vedic literature:\\näcäryavän puruño veda.  One who is in association with great äcäryas,  even if he\\nis not educated or has never studied the Vedas,  can become fami liar with all\\nthe knowledge necessary for realization.\\nThe process of devotional se rvice is a very happy one ( susukham ). Why?\\nDevotional service consists of çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù [SB 7.5.23] , so one can\\nsimply hear the chanting of the glories of the Lord or can attend philosophical\\nlectures on transcendenta l knowledge given by authorized äcäryas.  Simply by\\nsitting, one can learn; then one can ea t the remnants of the food offered to\\nGod, nice palatable dishes. In every stat e devotional service is joyful. One can\\nexecute devotional service even in the most pov erty-stricken condition. The\\nLord says, patraà puñpaà phalaà toyam : H e  i s  r e a d y  t o  a c c e p t  f r o m  t h e\\ndevotee any kind of offering, never mind what. Even a leaf, a flower, a bit of\\nfruit, or a little water, which are all av ailable in every part of the world, can be\\noffered by any person, regardless of social position, and will be accepted if\\noffered with love. There are many instan ces in history. Simply by tasting the\\ntulasé  leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, great sages like Sanat-kumära\\nbecame gre at devotees. Therefore the devotional process is very nice, and itCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.can be executed in a happy mood. God a ccepts only the love with which things\\nare offered to Him.\\nIt is said here that this devotional se rvice is eternally existing. It is not as\\nthe Mäyävädé philosophers claim. Althou gh they sometimes take to so-called\\ndevotional service, their idea is that as  long as they are not liberated they will\\ncontinue their de votional service, but at the end, when they become liberated,\\nthey will “become one with God.” Such  temporary time-serving devotional\\nservice is not accepted as pure devotion al service. Actual devotional service\\ncontinues even after liberation. When the de votee goes to the spiritual planet\\nin the kingdom of God, he is also en gaged there in serving the Supreme Lord.\\nHe does not try to become one with the Supreme Lord.\\nAs will be seen in Bhagavad-gétä,  actual devotional service begins after\\nliberation. After one is liberated, wh en one is situated in the Brahman\\nposition ( brahma-bhüta ), one’s devotional service begins ( samaù sarveñu\\nbhüteñu mad-bhaktià labhate paräm ). No one can understand the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead by executing karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga, añöäìga-yoga  or\\nany other yoga independently. By these yogic methods one may make a little\\nprogress toward bhakti-yoga,  but without coming to the stage of devotional\\nservice one cannot understand what is the Personality of Godhead. In the\\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam  it is also confirmed that when one becomes purified by\\nexecuting the process of devotional  service, especially by hearing\\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam  or Bhagavad-gétä  from re alized souls, then he can\\nunderstand the science of Kåñëa, or the science of God. Evaà\\nprasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti yogataù . When one’s heart is cleared of all\\nnonsense, then one can understand what God is. Thus the process of\\ndevotional service, of Kåñ ëa consciousness, is the king of all education and the\\nking of all confidential knowledge. It is  the purest form of religion, and it can\\nbe executed joyfully without difficulty. Therefore one should adopt it.\\nTEXT  3\\nAé[ÕDaaNaa\" Pauåza DaMaRSYaaSYa ParNTaPa )Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Therefore they return to the path of birth and death in\\nthis material world.\\nPURPORT\\nThe faithless cannot accomplish this pr ocess of devotional service; that is\\nthe purport of this verse. Faith is created by association with devotees.\\nUnfortunate people, even after hearing all the evidence of Vedic literature\\nfrom great personalities, stil l have no faith in God. They are hesitant and\\ncannot stay fixed in the devotional serv ice of the Lord. Thus faith is a most\\nimportant factor for progress in Kåñëa consciousness. In the\\nCaitanya-caritämåta  it is said that faith is the complete conviction th at simply\\nby serving the Supreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa, one can achieve all perfection. That is\\ncalled real faith. As stated in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (4.31.14 ),\\nyathä taror müla-niñecanena\\ntåpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopaçäkhäù\\npräëopahäräc ca yathendriyäëäàCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.tathaiva sarvärhaëam acyutejyä\\n“By giving water to the root of a tree one satisfies its branches, twigs and\\nleaves, and by supplying food to the stom ach one satisfies all the senses of the\\nbody. Similarly, by engaging in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord\\none automatically s atisfies all the demigods and all other living entities.”\\nTherefore, after reading Bhagavad-gétä  one should promptly come to the\\nconclusion of Bhagavad-gétä:  one should give up all other engagements and\\nadopt the service of the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, the Per sonality of Godhead. If\\none is convinced of this philosophy of life, that is faith.\\nNow, the development of that faith is the process of Kåñëa consciousness.\\nThere are three divisions of Kåñëa consci ous men. In the third class are those\\nwho have no faith. Even if they are officially engaged in devotional service,\\nthey cannot achieve the h ighest perfectional stage. Most probably they will\\nslip, after some time. They may become  engaged, but because they haven’t\\ncomplete conviction and faith, it is very difficult for them to continue in\\nKåñëa consciousness. We have practical experience in dis charging our\\nmissionary activity that some people come and apply themselves to Kåñëa\\nconsciousness with some hidden motive, and as soon as they are economically a\\nlittle well situated they give up this process and take to their old ways again. It\\nis only b y faith that one can advance in Kåñëa consciousness. As far as the\\ndevelopment of faith is concerned, one who is well versed in the literatures of\\ndevotional service and has attained the st age of firm faith is called a first-class\\nperson in Kåñëa conscious ness. And in the second class are those who are not\\nvery advanced in understanding the devotional scriptures but who\\nautomatically have firm faith that kåñëa-bhakti,  or service to Kåñëa, is the best\\ncourse and so in good faith ha ve taken it up. Thus they a re superior to the\\nthird class, who have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good\\nfaith but by association and simplicity are trying to follow. The third-class\\nperson in Kåñëa consciousness may fall down, but when one is in the second\\nclass he does not fall down, and for the first-class person in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness there is no chance of fa lling down. One in the first class will\\nsurely make progress and achieve the result  at the end. As far as the third-class\\nperson in Kåñëa consciousness is con cerned, although he has faith in theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.conviction that devotional service to Kå ñëa is very good, he has not yet gained\\nadequate knowledge of Kåñëa through the scriptures like Çrémad-Bhägavatam\\nand Bhagavad-gétä.  Sometimes these third-class persons in Kåñëa c onsciousness\\nhave some tendency toward karma-yoga  and jïäna-yoga,  and sometimes they\\nare disturbed, but as soon as the infection of karma-yoga  or jïäna-yoga  is\\nvanquished, they become second-class or first-class persons in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness. Faith in Kåñ ëa is also divided into three stages and described in\\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam.  First-class attachment, second-class attachment and\\nthird-class attachment are also explained in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  in the\\nEleventh Canto. Those who have no faith even after hearing ab out Kåñëa and\\nthe excellence of devotional service, wh o think that it is simply eulogy, find\\nthe path very difficult, even if they  are supposedly engaged in devotional\\nservice. For them there is very little ho pe of gaining perfection. Thus faith is\\nvery im portant in the discharge of devotional service.\\nTEXT  4\\nMaYaa TaTaiMad& Sav| JaGadVYa¢-MaUiTaRNaa )\\nMaTSQaaiNa SavR>aUTaaiNa Na cah& TaeZvviSQaTa\" )) 4 ))\\nmayä tatam idaà sarvaà\\njagad avyakta-mürtinä\\nmat-sthäni sarva-bhütäni\\nna cähaà teñv avasthitaù\\nSYNONYMS\\nmayä —by Me; tatam —pervaded; idam —this; sarvam —all; jagat —cosmic\\nmanifestation; avyakta-mürtinä —by the unmanifested form; mat-sthäni —in\\nMe; sarva-bhütäni —all living entities; na—not; ca—also; aham —I; teñu—in\\nthem; avasthitaù —situated.\\nTRANSLATIONCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

It is said,\\nataù çré-kåñëa-nämädi\\nna bhaved grähyam indriyaiù\\nsevonmukhe hi jihvädau\\nsvayam eva sphuraty adaù\\n(Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  1.2.234 )\\nLord Çré Kåñëa’s name, fame, pastim es, etc., cannot be understood by\\nmaterial senses. Only to one who is engaged in pure devotional service under\\nproper guidance is He revealed. In the Brahma-saàhitä  (5.38) it is stated,\\npremäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocane na santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti:  one\\ncan see the Supreme Personality of Godh ead, Govinda, always within himself\\nand outside himself if one has develope d the transcendental loving attitude\\ntowards Him. Thus for people in general He is not visible. He re it is said that\\nalthough He is all-pervading, everywhere  present, He is not conceivable by the\\nmaterial senses. This is indicated here by the word avyakta-mürtinä.  But\\nactually, although we cannot see Him, everything is resting in Him. As we\\nhave discus sed in the Seventh Chapter, the entire material cosmic\\nmanifestation is only a combination of His two different energies—the\\nsuperior, spiritual energy and the inferio r, material energy. Just as the sunshine\\nis spread all over the universe, the energy of t he Lord is spread all over the\\ncreation, and everything is resting in that energy.\\nYet one should not conclude that becaus e He is spread all over He has lost\\nHis personal existence. To refute su ch an argument the Lord says, “I am\\neverywhere, and everything is in Me, bu t still I am aloof.” For example, a king\\nheads a government which is b ut the manifestation of the king’s energy; the\\ndifferent governmental departments are nothing but the energies of the king,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The Lo rd is not directly concerned with the\\nmaintenance and sustenance of this mate rial manifestation. Sometimes we see\\na picture of Atlas holding  the globe on his shoulders; he seems to be very tired,\\nholding this great earthly planet. Such an image should not be entertained in\\nconnection with Kåñëa’s upholding th is created universe. He says that\\nalthough everything is resting on Him, He is aloof. The planetary systems are\\nfloating in space, and this space is th e energy of the Supreme Lord. But He is\\ndifferent from space. He is different ly situated. Therefore the Lord says,\\n“Although they are situated on My inconceivable energy, as the Supreme\\nPerso nality of Godhead I am aloof from them.” This is the inconceivable\\nopulence of the Lord.\\nIn the Nirukti  Vedic dictionary it is said, yujyate ’nena durghaöeñu käryeñu:\\n“The Supreme Lord is performing inconceivably wonderful pastimes,\\ndisplaying His energy.” His person is fu ll of different potent energies, and His\\ndetermination is itself actual fact. In this way the Personality of Godhead is to\\nbe understood. We may think of doin g something, but there are so many\\nimpediments, and sometimes it is not possi ble to do as we like. But when Kåñëa\\nwants to do something, simply by His willing, everything  is performed so\\nperfectly that one cannot imagine how it  is being done. The Lord explains this\\nfact: although He is the maintainer and sustainer of the entire material\\nmanifestation, He does not touch this material manifestation. Simply by His\\nsupreme wil l, everything is created, everything is sustained, everything is\\nmaintained, and everything is annihilate d. There is no difference between His\\nmind and Himself (as there is a difference between ourselves and our present\\nmaterial mind) because He is absolut e spirit. Simultaneously the Lord is\\npresent in everything; yet the common man cannot understand how He is also\\npresent personally.

Similarly, all the wonderful cosmic man ifestations are existing\\nby the supreme will of God, and all of them are subordinate to that supreme\\nwill. As we generally say, not a blade of grass moves without the will of theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus everything is moving under His will:\\nby His will everything is being created, everything is being maintained, and\\neverything is being annihilated. Still He  is aloof from everything, as the sky is\\nalways aloof from the activities of the wind.\\nIn the Upaniñads  it is stated, yad-bhéñä vätaù pavate:  “It is out of the fear of\\nthe Supreme Lord that the wind is blowing.” ( Taittiréya Upaniñad  2.8.1) In the\\nBåhad-äraëyaka Upaniñad  (3.8.9 ) it is stated, etasya vä akñarasya praçäsane gärgi\\nsürya-candrama sau vidhåtau tiñöhata etasya vä akñarasya praçäsane gärgi\\ndyäv-äpåthivyau vidhåtau tiñöhataù.  “By the supreme order, under the\\nsuperintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the moon, the sun,\\nand the other great planets are moving.” In the Brahma- saàhitä  (5.52) also it is\\nstated,\\nyac-cakñur eña savitä sakala-grahäëäà\\nräjä samasta-sura-mürtir açeña-tejäù\\nyasyäjïayä bhramati sambhåta-käla-cakro\\ngovindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi\\nThis is a description of the movement of  the sun.

It is clearly indicated here by the\\nword avaçam  that the living entities have nothing to do with this process. The\\nstate of being in their past life  in the past creation is sim ply manifested again,\\nand all this is done simply by His will. This is the inconceivable potency of the\\nSupreme Personality of God. And after creating different species of life, He\\nhas no connection with them.

Kåñëa also states\\nin Bhagavad-gétä  that of all of the living entiti es in different forms and species,\\n“I am the father.” The father gives seeds to the womb of the mother for the\\nchild, and similarly the Supreme Lord by His me re glance injects all the living\\nentities into the womb of material natu re, and they come out in their different\\nforms and species, according to their last  desires and activities. All these living\\nentities, although born under the glance of the Supreme Lor d, take their\\ndifferent bodies according to their past deeds and desires. So the Lord is not\\ndirectly attached to this material creation. He simply glances over material\\nnature; material nature is thus activated, and everything is created\\nimmediately.

The Personality of Godhead, whoCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.conducts the creation, maintenance and anni hilation of the complete cosmic\\nmanifestation, cannot be a human being. Yet there are many foolish men who\\nconsider Kåñëa to be merely a powerful man and nothing more. Actually, He is\\nthe original Supreme Personality, as is confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä\\n(éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù ); He is the Supreme Lord.\\nThere are many éçvaras,  controllers, and one appears greater than another.\\nIn the ordinary management of affairs in the material world, we find some\\nofficial or director, and above him there is a secretary, and above him a\\nminister, and above him a preside nt. Each of them is a controller, but one is\\ncontrolled by another. In the Brahma-saàhitä  it is said that Kåñëa is the\\nsupreme controller; there are many cont rollers undoubtedly, both in the\\nmaterial and spiritual world, but Kåñëa is the supreme controller  (éçvaraù\\nparamaù kåñëaù ). and His body is sac-cid-änanda,  nonmaterial.\\nMaterial bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous\\nverses. His body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Although He is not a\\ncommon man, the foolish deride Him and consider Him to be a man. His body\\nis called here mänuñém  becau se He is acting just like a man, a friend of\\nArjuna’s, a politician involved in the Ba ttle of Kurukñetra. In so many ways He\\nis acting just like an ordinary man, but actually His body is\\nsac-cid-änanda-vigraha  [Bs. 5.1]—eternal bliss and knowledge absolute . This is\\nconfirmed in the Vedic language also. Sac-cid-änanda-rüpäya kåñëäya:  “I offer\\nmy obeisances unto the Supreme Person ality of Godhead, Kåñëa, who is the\\neternal blissful form of knowledge.” ( Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad  1.1) There are\\nother descriptions in the Vedic language also. Tam ekaà govindam:  “You are\\nGovinda, the pleasure of the senses and the cows.” Sac-cid-änanda-vigraham:\\n“And Your form is transcendental, full of knowledge, bliss and eternality.”\\n(Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad  1.35)\\nDespite the transcendental qualities of  Lord Kåñëa’s body, its full bliss and\\nknowledge, there are many so-called scholars and commentators of\\nBhagavad-gétä  who deride Kåñëa as an ordina ry man. The scholar may be born\\nan extraordinary man due to his previo us good work, but this conception of Çré\\nKåñëa is due to a poor fund of knowledge. Therefore he is called müòha.  for\\nonly foolish persons consider Kåñëa to  b e  a n  o r d i n a r y  h u m a n  b e i n g .  T h eCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.foolish consider Kåñëa an ordinary human being because they do not k now the\\nconfidential activities of the Suprem e Lord and His different energies. They\\ndo not know that Kåñëa’s body is a sy mbol of complete knowledge and bliss,\\nthat He is the proprietor of everyt hing that be and that He can award\\nliberation to anyone. Beca use they do not know that Kåñëa has so many\\ntranscendental qualifications, they deride Him.\\nNor do they know that the appear ance of the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead in this material world is a mani festation of His internal energy. He is\\nthe master of the material energy. As  has been explained in several places\\n(mama mäyä duratyayä ), He claims t hat the material energy, although very\\npowerful, is under His control, and wh oever surrenders unto Him can get out\\nof the control of this material energy. If a soul surrendered to Kåñëa can get\\nout of the influence of material energy, then how can the Supr eme Lord, who\\nconducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the whole cosmic\\nnature, have a material body like us? So  this conception of Kåñëa is complete\\nfoolishness. Foolish persons, however, cannot conceive that the Personality of\\nGodhead, Kåñë a, appearing just like an ordinary man, can be the controller of\\nall the atoms and of the gigantic mani festation of the universal form. The\\nbiggest and the minutest are beyond th eir conception, so they cannot imagine\\nthat a form like that of a human being can simultaneously control the infinite\\nand the minute. Actually although He is controlling the infinite and the\\nfinite, He is apart from all this manife station. It is clearly stated concerning\\nHis yogam aiçvaram , His inconceivable transcendental energy, t hat He can\\ncontrol the infinite and the finite si multaneously and that He can remain\\naloof from them. Although the foolish cannot imagine how Kåñëa, who\\nappears just like a human being, can co ntrol the infinite and the finite, those\\nwho are pure devotees a ccept this, for they know that Kåñëa is the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead. Therefore they  completely surrender unto Him and\\nengage in Kåñëa consciousness, devotional service of the Lord.\\nThere are many controversies between the impersonalists and the\\npersonalists about the Lord’s appearance  as a human being. But if we consult\\nBhagavad-gétä  and Çrémad-Bhägavatam,  the authoritative texts for\\nunderstanding the science of Kåñëa, then we can un derstand that Kåñëa is theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is not an ordinary man, although He\\nappeared on this earth as an ordinary human. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam,  First\\nCanto, First Chapter, when the sages he aded by Çaunaka inquired about the\\nactivit ies of Kåñëa, they said:\\nkåtavän kila karmäëi\\nsaha rämeëa keçavaù\\nati-martyäni bhagavän\\ngüòhaù kapaöa-mäëuñaù\\n“Lord Çré Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, along with\\nBalaräma, played like a human being, and so masked He performed many\\nsuperhuman acts.” ( Bhäg.  1.1.20 ) The Lord’s appearance as a man bewilders the\\nfoolish. No human being could perform the won derful acts that Kåñëa\\nperformed while He was present on this  earth. When Kåñëa appeared before\\nHis father and mother, Vasudeva and Devaké, He appeared with four hands,\\nbut after the prayers of the parents He  transformed Himself into an ordinary\\nchild. As stated in the Bhägavatam  (10.3.46 ), babhüva präkåtaù çiçuù:  He\\nbecame just like an ordinary child, an  ordinary human being. Now, here again\\nit is indicated that the Lord’s appearan ce as an ordinary human being is one of\\nthe features of His transcendental b ody. In the Eleventh Chapter of\\nBhagavad-gétä  also it is stated that Arjuna prayed to see Kåñëa’s form of four\\nhands ( tenaiva rüpeëa catur-bhujena ). After revealing this form, Kåñëa, when\\npetitioned by Arjuna, again assumed His original humanlike form ( mänuñaà\\nrüpam ). These different features of the Supreme Lord are certainly not those\\nof an ordinary human being.\\nSome of those who deride Kåñëa and who are infected with the Mäyävädé\\nphilosophy quote the following verse from the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (3.29.21 ) to\\nprove that Kåñëa is just an ordinary man. Ahaà sarveñu bhüteñu\\nbhütätmävasthitaù sadä:  “The Supreme is presen t in every living entity.” We\\nshould better take note of this particular verse from the Vaiñëava äcäryas  like\\nJéva Gosvämé and Viçvanätha Cakravar té Öhäkura instead of following the\\ninterpretation of unauthorized pers ons who deride Kåñëa. Jéva Gosvämé,\\ncommenting on this verse, says that Kåñëa, in His plenary expansion asCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Paramätmä, is situated in the moving  and the nonmoving entities as the\\nSupersoul, so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the\\narcä-mürti,  the form of the Supreme Lord in the temple, and does not respect\\nother living entities is uselessly worshiping the form of the Lord in the temple.\\nThere are three kinds of devotees of the Lord, and the neophyte is in the\\nlowest stage. The neophyte devot ee gives more attention to the Deit y in the\\ntemple than to other devotees, so Vi çvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura warns that\\nthis sort of mentality should be corre cted. A devotee should see that because\\nKåñëa is present in everyone’s hear t as Paramätmä, every body is the\\nembodiment or the temple of the Supreme Lord; so as one offers respect to the\\ntemple of the Lord, he should similarly properly respect each and every body in\\nwhich the Paramätmä dwells. Everyone  should therefore be given proper\\nrespect and should not be neglected.\\nThere are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship. They say\\nthat since God is everywhere, why sh ould one restrict himself to temple\\nworship? But if God is everywhere, is He not in the temple or in the Deity?\\nAlthough the personalist and the impe rsonalist will fight with one another\\nperpetually, a perfect devotee in Kåñë a consciousness knows that although\\nKåñëa is the Supreme Personality, He is  all-pervading, as confirmed in the\\nBrahma-saàhitä . Although His personal abode is Goloka Våndävana and H e is\\nalways staying there, by His different manifestations of energy and by His\\nplenary expansion He is present everywhe re in all parts of the material and\\nspiritual creation.\\nTEXT  12\\nMaaegaaXaa Maaegak-MaaR<aae MaaegajaNaa ivceTaSa\" )\\nra+aSaqMaaSaurq& cEv Pa[k*-iTa& MaaeihNaq& ié[Taa\" )) 12 ))\\nmoghäçä mogha-karmäëo\\nmogha-jïänä vicetasaù\\nräkñasém äsuréà caiva\\nprakåtià mohinéà çritäùCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

For them, the fruit of\\ndevotional service—going back to Godhead—w ill never be tasted. Similarly,\\nthose who are engaged in fruitive pious activities and who are ultimately\\nhoping to be liberated from this mate rial entanglement will never be successful\\neither, because they deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa.  In\\nother words, persons who mock Kåñëa are to be understood to be demonic or\\natheistic. As described in the Seventh Chapter  of Bhagavad-gétä,  such demonic\\nmiscreants never surrender to Kåñëa. Therefore their mental speculations to\\narrive at the Absolute T ruth bring them to the false conclusion that the\\nordinary living entity and Kåñëa are one and the same. With such a false\\nconviction, they think that the body of any human being is now simply\\ncovered by material nature and that as soon as one is liberated from this\\nmaterial body there is no difference between God and himself.

The first sign\\nof the mahätmä  is that he is already situated in the divine nature. He is not\\nunder the control of material nature. And how is this effected? That is\\nexplained in the Seventh Cha pter: one who surrenders unto the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, at once becomes freed from the control of\\nmaterial nature. That is the qualific ation. One can become free from the\\ncontrol of material nature as s oon as he surrenders his soul to the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead. That is the preliminary formula. Being marginal\\npotency, as soon as the living entity  is freed from the control of material\\nnature, he is put under the guidance of  the spiritual nature. The guidance of\\nthe spiritual natu re is called daivé prakåti,  divine nature. So when one is\\npromoted in that way—by surrender ing to the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead—one attains to the stage of great soul, mahätmä.\\nThe mahätmä  does not divert his attention to anything outside Kåñëa,\\nbecause he knows perfectly well that Kåñë a is the original Supreme Person, the\\ncause of all causes. There is no doubt about it. Such a mahätmä,  or great soul,\\ndevelops through association  with other mahätmäs,  pure devotees. Pure\\ndevotees are not even attracted by Kåñëa’s other features, such as the\\nfour-armed Mahä-Viñëu. They are simply attracted by the two-armed form of\\nKåñëa.

He is described\\nin a different way in the next verse. The mahätmä  is always engaged in\\ndifferent activities of devotional service, as described in the\\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam,  hearing and chanting about Viñëu, not a demigod or\\nhuman being. That is devotion: çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù  and smaraëam ,\\nremembering Him. Such a mahätmä  has firm determination to achieve at the\\nultimate end t he association of the Supreme Lord in any one of the five\\ntranscendental rasas.  To achieve that success, he engages all\\nactivities—mental, bodily and vocal, everything—in the service of the\\nSupreme Lord, Çré Kåñëa. That is called full Kåñëa consciousness.\\nIn devotional service there are certain activities which are called\\ndetermined, such as fasting on certain da ys, like the eleventh day of the moon,\\nEkädaçé, and on the appearance da y of the Lord.

One does not need to\\nundergo any severe penance and austerity. He can live this life in devotional\\nservice, guided by an ex pert spiritual master, and in any position, either as a\\nhouseholder or a sannyäsé  or a brahmacäré;  in any position and anywhere in\\nthe world, he can perform this devotion al service to the Supreme Personality\\nof Godhead and thus become actually mahätmä,  a great soul.\\nTEXT  15\\njaNaYajeNa caPYaNYae YaJaNTaae MaaMauPaaSaTae )Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

These are vividly d escribed in the fruitive activities portion\\nof the Vedas,  which recommends a specific worship of demigods situated on\\ndifferent heavenly planets. Similarly,  one can attain the Pitä planets by\\nperforming a specific yajïa.  Similarly, one can go to many ghost ly planets and\\nbecome a Yakña, Rakña or Piçäca. Piçäca worship is called “black arts” or “black\\nmagic.” There are many men who practice this black art, and they think that it\\nis spiritualism, but such activities are completely materialistic. Similarly, a p ure\\ndevotee, who worships the Supreme Pers onality of Godhead only, achieves the\\nplanets of Vaikuëöha and Kåñëaloka without a doubt. It is very easy to\\nunderstand through this important verse that if by simply worshiping the\\ndemigods one can achieve the hea venly planets, or by worshiping the Pitäs\\nachieve the Pitä planets, or by practi cing the black arts achieve the ghostly\\nplanets, why can the pure devotee not achieve the planet of Kåñëa or Viñëu?\\nUnfortunately many people have no information of these subli me planets\\nwhere Kåñëa and Viñëu live, and because they do not know of them they fall\\ndown.

The process of achieving such\\na marvelous result is v ery easy and can be attempted even by the poorest of the\\npoor, without any kind of qualification. The only qualification required in thisCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.connection is to be a pure devotee of the Lord. It does not matter what one is\\nor where one is situated. The process i s so easy that even a leaf or a little water\\nor fruit can be offered to the Supreme Lord in genuine love and the Lord will\\nbe pleased to accept it. No one, therefore, can be barred from Kåñëa\\nconsciousness, because it is so easy and universal. Who is such a fool that he\\ndoes not want to be Kåñëa conscious by this simple method and thus attain the\\nhighest perfectional life of eternity, bliss and knowledge? Kåñëa wants only\\nloving service and nothing more. Kåñëa accepts even a little flower from His\\npure devo tee. He does not want any kind of  offering from a nondevotee. He is\\nnot in need of anything from anyone, because He is self-sufficient, and yet He\\naccepts the offering of His devotee in an exchange of love and affection. To\\ndevelop Kåñëa consciousness is t he highest perfection of life. Bhakti  is\\nmentioned twice in this verse in order to declare more emphatically that\\nbhakti,  or devotional service, is the only means to approach Kåñëa. No other\\ncondition, such as becoming a brähmaëa.  a learned scholar, a very  rich man or\\na great philosopher, can induce Kåñëa to accept some offering. Without the\\nbasic principle of bhakti,  nothing can induce the Lord to agree to accept\\nanything from anyone. Bhakti  is never causal. The process is eternal. It is\\ndirect action in s ervice to the absolute whole.\\nHere Lord Kåñëa, having establishe d that He is the only enjoyer, the\\nprimeval Lord and the real object of all sacrificial offerings, reveals what types\\nof sacrifices He desires to be offered.  If one wishes to engage in devotional\\nservice to the Supreme in order to be purified and to reach the goal of\\nlife—the transcendental loving servic e of God—then one should find out\\nwhat the Lord desires of him. One wh o loves Kåñëa will give Him whatever He\\nwants, and he avoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked. Thus\\nmeat, fish and eggs should not be offered to Kåñëa. If He desired such things as\\nofferings, He would have said so. Instead He clearly requests that a leaf, fruit,\\nflowers and water be given to Him, and He  says of this offering, “I will accept\\nit.” Therefore, we should understand that He will not accept meat, fish and\\neggs. Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk an d water are the proper foods for human\\nbeings and are prescribed by Lord Kåñë a Himself. Whatever else we eat cannot\\nbe offered to Him, sin ce He will not accept it. Thus  we cannot be acting on theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.level of loving devotion if we offer such foods.\\nIn the Third Chapter, verse thirteen , Çré Kåñëa explains that only the\\nremains of sacrifice are purified and fit for consumption by those who are\\nseeking advancement in life and releas e from the clutches of the material\\nentanglement. Those who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the\\nsame verse, are eating only sin. In ot her words, their every mouthful is simply\\ndeepening their involvement in the co mplexities of material nature. But\\npreparing nice, simple vegetable dishes, offering them before the picture or\\nDeity of Lord Kåñëa and bowing down and praying for Him to accept such a\\nhumble offering enables one to advance steadily in life, to purify the body, and\\nto create fine brain tissues which will lead to clear thinking. Above all, the\\noffering  should be made with an attitude of love. Kåñëa has no need of food,\\nsince He already possesses everything th at be, yet He will accept the offering\\nof one who desires to please Him in that way. The important element, in\\npreparation, in serving and in offer ing, is to act with love for Kåñëa.\\nThe impersonalist philosophers, who wish to maintain that the Absolute\\nTruth is without senses, cannot comprehend this verse of Bhagavad-gétä.  To\\nthem, it is either a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of Kåñëa, the\\nspeaker of the Bhagavad-gétä.  But, in actuality, Kåñëa, the Supreme Godhead,\\nhas senses, and it is stated that His se nses are interchangeable; in other words,\\none sense can perform the function of an y other. This is what it means to say\\nthat Kåñëa is absolute. Lacking senses, He could ha rdly be considered full in all\\nopulences. In the Seventh Chapter, Kåñë a has explained that He impregnates\\nthe living entities into material natu re. This is done by His looking upon\\nmaterial nature. And so in this instance, Kåñëa’s hearing the devotee’s wor ds\\nof love in offering foodstuffs is wholly  identical with His eating and actually\\ntasting. This point should be emphasized : because of His absolute position, His\\nhearing is wholly identical with His eati ng and tasting. Only the devotee, who\\naccepts Kåñëa as He describes Himself, without interpretation, can understand\\nthat the Supreme Absolute Truth can eat food and enjoy it.\\nTEXT  27Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Therefore if actions are performed and the fruits\\nare given to Kåñëa, then that is called yukta-vairägya.  Actually situated in\\nrenunciation, such activi ties clear the mirror of the mind, and as the actor\\ngradually makes progress in spiritual realization he becomes completely\\nsurrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore at the end he\\nbecomes liberated, and this liberation is also specified.  By this liberation he\\ndoes not become one with the brahmajyoti,  but rather enters into the planet of\\nthe Supreme Lord. It is clearly mentioned here: mäm upaiñyasi,  “he comes to\\nMe,” back home, back to Godhead. There are five different stages of liberation ,\\nand here it is specified that the devot ee who has always lived his lifetime here\\nunder the direction of the Supreme Lord , as stated, has evolved to the point\\nwhere he can, after quitting this body, go back to Godhead and engage directly\\nin the associatio n of the Supreme Lord.\\nAnyone who has no interest but to dedi cate his life to the service of the\\nLord is actually a sannyäsé.  Such a person always thinks of himself as an eternal\\nservant, dependent on the supreme will of the Lord. As such, whatever he\\ndoes, he does it for the be nefit of the Lord. Whatever  action he performs, he\\nperforms it as service to the Lord. He does not give serious attention to the\\nfruitive activities or prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas.  For ordinary\\npersons it is obligatory to execute the prescribe d duties mentioned in the\\nVedas,  but although a pure devotee who is completely engaged in the service of\\nthe Lord may sometimes appear to go against the prescribed Vedic duties,\\nactually it is not so.\\nIt is said, therefore, by Vaiñëava authorities that even the most intelligent\\nperson cannot understand the plans and activities of a pure devotee.

The Lord claims that every living\\nentity—in whatever form—is His son, an d so He provides everyone with a\\ngenerous supply of the necessities of life.  He is just like a cloud which pours\\nrain all over, regardless of whether it falls  on rock or land or water. But for His\\ndevotees, He gives specific attention. Such devotees are mentioned here: they\\nare always in Kåñëa consciousness, and therefore they are  always\\ntranscendentally situated in Kåñëa. The very phrase “Kåñëa consciousness”\\nsuggests that those who are in such cons ciousness are living transcendentalists,\\ns i t u a t e d  i n  H i m .

The Lord’s\\nreciprocation should not be considered to be under the law of karma.  It\\nbelongs to the transcendental situatio n in which the Lord and His devotees\\nfunction.

When a living entity is conditioned, he has two kinds\\nof activities: one is conditional, an d the other is constitutional. As for\\nprotecting the body or abid ing by the rules of society and state, certainly there\\nare different activities, even for the devotees, in connection with the\\nconditional life, and such activities ar e called conditional. Besides these, the\\nliving entity who is fully conscious of his spir itual nature and is engaged in\\nKåñëa consciousness, or the devotional service of the Lord, has activities whichCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.are called transcendental. Such activities are performed in his constitutional\\nposition, and they are technically called devotional service. Now , in the\\nconditioned state, sometimes devotional  service and the conditional service in\\nrelation to the body will parallel one another. But then again, sometimes these\\nactivities become opposed to one another. As far as possible, a devotee is very\\ncautious  s o  t h a t  h e  d o e s  n o t  d o  a n y t h i n g  that could disrupt his wholesome\\ncondition. He knows that perfection  in his activities depends on his\\nprogressive realization of Kåñëa consci ousness. Sometimes, however, it may be\\nseen that a person in Kåñëa consciousness c ommits some act which may be\\ntaken as most abominable socially or politically. But such a temporary falldown\\ndoes not disqualify him. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  it is stated that if a person\\nfalls down but is wholeheartedly engaged in the transcendental serv ice of the\\nSupreme Lord, the Lord, being situated within his heart, purifies him and\\nexcuses him from that abomination. Th e material contamination is so strong\\nthat even a yogé fully engaged in the service of the Lord sometimes becomes\\nensnared; but Kåñëa consciousness is so strong that such an occasional\\nfalldown is at once rectified. Therefor e the process of devotional service is\\nalways a success. No one should deride a devotee for some accidental falldown\\nfrom the ideal path, for, as explained in the nex t verse, such occasional\\nfalldowns will be stopped in due course, as soon as a devotee is completely\\nsituated in Kåñëa consciousness.\\nTherefore a person who is situated in  Kåñëa consciousness and is engaged\\nwith determination in the process of ch anting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa\\nKåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare should be\\nconsidered to be in the transcendent al position, even if by chance or accident\\nhe is found to have fallen. The words sädhur eva,  “he is saintly,” are very\\nemphatic. They are a warning to the nondevotees that because of an\\naccidental falldown a devotee should not be derided; he should still b e\\nconsidered saintly even if he has accidentally fallen down. And the word\\nmantavyaù  is still more emphatic. If one does  not follow this rule, and derides a\\ndevotee for his accidental falldown, then  one is disobeying the order of the\\nSupreme Lord. The only  qualification of a devotee is to be unflinchingly and\\nexclusively engaged in devotional service.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Such spots d o not become an impediment to the diffusion of\\nmoonlight. Similarly, the accidental falldown of a devotee from the path of\\nsaintly character does not make him abominable.\\nOn the other hand, one should no t misunderstand that a devotee in\\ntranscendental devotional service can ac t in all kinds of abominable ways; this\\nverse only refers to an accident due to the strong power of material\\nconnections. Devotional service is more o r less a declaration of war against the\\nillusory energy. As long as one is no t strong enough to fight the illusory\\nenergy, there may be accidental falldowns. But when one is strong enough, he\\nis no longer subjected to such falldowns, as previously explaine d.

Th e miscreants, as stated in the Seventh\\nChapter, who never come to the devoti onal service of the Lord, have n o good\\nqualifications, as is stated in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam.  Generally, a devotee who\\nis engaged in the nine kinds of devotion al activities is engaged in the process\\nof cleansing all material contamination from the heart. He puts the Supreme\\nPersonality o f Godhead within his heart, and all sinful contaminations are\\nnaturally washed away. Continuous thinking of the Supreme Lord makes him\\npure by nature. According to the Vedas,  there is a certain regulation that if\\none falls down from his exalted position he  has to undergo certain ritualistic\\nprocesses to purify himself. But here there is no such condition, because the\\npurifying process is already there in the heart of the devotee, due to his\\nremembering the Supreme Personalit y of Godhead constantly.

Theref ore devotional service and\\nthe guidance of a pure devotee are so strong that there is no discrimination\\nbetween the lower and higher classes of men; anyone can take to it. The most\\nsimple man taking shelter of the pure devotee can be purified by proper\\nguidance. According to the different modes of material nature, men are\\nclassified in the mode of goodness ( brähmaëas ), the mode of passion ( kñatriyas,\\nor administrators), the mixed modes of passion and ignorance ( vaiçyas,  or\\nmerchants), and the mode of ignora nce ( çüdras,  or workers). Those lower than\\nthem are called caëòälas,  and they are born in sinful families. Generally, the\\nassociation of those born in sinful fa milies is not accepted by the higher\\nclasses. But the process of devotional service is so strong  that the pure devotee\\nof the Supreme Lord can enable people of all the lower classes to attain the\\nhighest perfection of life. This is possi ble only when one takes shelter of Kåñëa.\\nAs indicated here by the word vyapäçritya,  one has to take shelter comple tely\\nof Kåñëa.

Sometimes unscrupulous comment ators distort the meaning of what is\\nclearly stated here: that all devo tional service should be offered to the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Unfortunately, unscrupulous\\ncommentators divert the mind of the reader to that which is not at all feasible.\\nSuch commentators do not know that there is no difference between Kå ñëa’s\\nmind and Kåñëa. Kåñëa is not an ordina ry human being; He is Absolute Truth.\\nHis body, His mind and He Himself are on e and absolute. It is stated in the\\nKürma Puräëa.  as it is quoted by Bhaktisi ddhänta Sarasvaté Gosvämé in his\\nAnubhäñya  comments on Caitanya-caritämåta  (Fifth Chapter, Ädi-lélä,  verses\\n41–48 ), deha-dehi-vibhedo ’yaà neçvare vidyate kvacit.  This means that there is\\nno difference in Kåñëa, the Supreme Lord, between Himself and His body. But\\nbecause the commentators do not know this science  of Kåñëa, they hide KåñëaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.and divide His personality from His mind or from His body. Although this is\\nsheer ignorance of the science of Kå ñëa, some men make profit out of\\nmisleading people.\\nThere are some who are demonic; they also think of Kåñëa, but enviously,\\njust like King Kaàsa, Kåñëa’s uncle. He was also thinking of Kåñëa always, but\\nhe thought of Kåñëa as his enemy. He was always in anxiety, wondering when\\nKåñëa would come to kill him.  That kind of thinking will not help us. One\\nshould be thinking of Kåñëa in devotional love. That is bhakti.  One should\\ncultivate the knowledge of Kåñëa cont inuously. What is that favorable\\ncultivation? It is to learn from a bona fide teacher. Kåñëa is the  Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead, and we have several times explained that His body is\\nnot material, but is eternal, blissful kn owledge. This kind of talk about Kåñëa\\nwill help one become a devotee. Understanding Kåñëa otherwise, from the\\nwrong source, will  prove fruitless.\\nOne should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form, the primal form\\nof Kåñëa; with conviction in his heart that Kåñëa is the Supreme, he should\\nengage himself in worship. There are hundreds of thousands of temples in\\nIndia for the worship of Kåñëa, a nd devotional service is practiced there.\\nWhen such practice is made, one has to  offer obeisances to Kåñëa. One should\\nlower his head before the Deity and engage his mind, his body, his\\nactivities—everything. That will make one fully absorbed in Kåñëa with out\\ndeviation. This will help one transfer  to the Kåñëaloka. One should not be\\ndeviated by unscrupulous commentat ors. One must engage in the nine\\ndifferent processes of devotional service, beginning with hearing and chanting\\nabout Kåñëa. Pure devotional se rvice is the highest achievement of human\\nsociety.\\nThe Seventh and Eighth chapters of Bhagavad-gétä  have explained pure\\ndevotional service to the Lord that is  free from speculative knowledge, mystic\\nyoga and fruitive activities. Those who are not purely sanctified may be\\nattracted by different features of the Lord like the impersonal brahmajyoti  and\\nlocalized Paramätmä, but a pure devotee directly takes to the service of the\\nSupreme Lord.\\nThere is a beautiful poem about Kåñëa in which it is clearly stated that anyCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.person who is engaged in the worship of  demigods is most unintelligent and\\ncannot achieve at any time the supreme award of Kåñëa. The devotee, in the\\nbeginning, may sometimes fall  from the standard, but still he should be\\nconsidered superior to all other philosophers and yogés.  One who always\\nengages in Kåñëa consciousness should be  understood to be a perfectly saintly\\nperson. His accidental nondevot ional activities will diminish, and he will soon\\nbe situated without any doubt in comple te perfection. The pure devotee has no\\nactual chance to fall down, because the Supreme Godhead personally takes\\ncare of His pure devotees. Therefore,  the intelligent person should take\\ndirectly to the  process of Kåñëa consciousness and happily live in this material\\nworld. He will eventually receive the supreme award of Kåñëa.\\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Ninth Chapter of the Çrémad\\nBhagavad-gétä  in the matter of the Most Confidential Knowledge.\\n- CHAPTER 10 -\\nThe Opulence of the Absolute\\nTEXT  1\\né[q>aGavaNauvac\\n>aUYa Wv Mahabahae é*<au Mae ParMa& vc\" )\\nYatae_h& Pa[qYaMaa<aaYa v+YaaiMa ihTak-aMYaYaa )) 1 ))\\nçré-bhagavän uväca\\nbhüya eva mahä-bäho\\nçåëu me paramaà vacaùCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

While\\nKåñëa was present on this earth,  He displayed all six opulences. Therefore\\ngreat sages like Paräçara Muni have all accepted Kåñëa as the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead. Now Kåñëa is in structing Arjuna in more confidential\\nknowledge of His opulences and His work. Previously, beginning wit h the\\nSeventh Chapter, the Lord has already explained His different energies and\\nhow they are acting. Now in this chapte r He explains His specific opulences to\\nArjuna. In the previous chapter He has clearly explained His different\\nenergies to establish dev otion in firm conviction. Again in this chapter He\\ntells Arjuna about His manifestations and various opulences.\\nThe more one hears about the Suprem e God, the more one becomes fixed\\nin devotional service.

No one\\nis greater than Him; He is the cause of a ll causes. Here it is also stated by the\\nLord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and sages. Even the\\ndemigods and great sages cannot understand Kåñëa; they can understand\\nneither His name nor His personality, so what is the position of the so-calledCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.s c h o l a r s  o f  t h i s  t i n y  p l a n e t ?  N o  o n e can understand why this Supreme God\\ncomes to earth as an ordinary  human being and executes such  wonderful,\\nuncommon activities. One should know, then, that scholarship is not the\\nqualification necessary to understand Kå ñëa. Even the demigods and the great\\nsages have tried to understand Kåñëa by their mental speculation, and they\\nhave failed to do so . In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  also it is clearly said that even\\nthe great demigods are not able to understand the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead. They can speculate to the limi ts of their imperfect senses and can\\nreach the opposite conclusion of impersonalism , of something not manifested\\nby the three qualities of material na ture, or they can imagine something by\\nmental speculation, but it is not possibl e to understand Kåñëa by such foolish\\nspeculation.\\nHere the Lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the Absolute\\nTruth, “Here I am present as the Supr eme Personality of Godhead. I am the\\nSupreme.” One should know this. Al though one cannot understand the\\ninconceivable Lord who is personally presen t, He nonetheless exists. We can\\nactually understand Kåñëa, who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, simply\\nby studying His words in Bhagavad-gétä  and Çrémad-Bhägavatam.  The\\nconception of God as some ruling powe r or as the impersonal Brahman can be\\nreached by persons who are in the infe rior energy of the Lord, but the\\nPersonality of Godhead cannot be conceived unless one is in the\\ntranscendental position.\\nBecause most men cannot understand Kåñëa in His actual situation, out of\\nHis causeless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators. Yet despite\\nthe Supreme Lord’s uncommon activities, these speculators, due to\\ncontamination in the material energy, still think that the impersonal Brahman\\nis the Supreme. Only the devotees who are fully surrendered unto the Supreme\\nLord can understand, by the grace of the Supreme Personality, that He is\\nKåñëa. The devotees of the Lord do not bother about the impersonal  Brahman\\nconception of God; their faith an d devotion bring them to surrender\\nimmediately unto the Supreme Lord, and out of the causeless mercy of Kåñëa\\nthey can understand Kåñëa. No one else  can understand Him. So even great\\nsages agree: What is ätmä,  what  i s  t h e  S u p r e m e ?

But\\nout of those actually trying to unders tand their spiritual situation, one who\\ncan come to the understanding that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead, the proprietor of ever ything, the unborn, is the mos t successful\\nspiritually realized person. In that st age only, when one has fully understoodCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Kåñëa’s supreme position, can one be free completely from all sinful reactions.\\nHere the Lord is described by the word aja, meaning “unborn,” but He is\\ndistinct from the living entities who are described in the Second Chapter as\\naja. The Lord is different from the living entities who are taking birth and\\ndying due to material attachme nt. The conditioned souls are changing their\\nbodies, but His body is not changeable. Even when He comes to this material\\nworld, He comes as the same unborn; ther efore in the Fourth Chapter it is said\\nthat the Lord, by His internal  potency, is not under the  inferior, material\\nenergy, but is always in the superior energy.\\nIn this verse the words vetti loka-maheçvaram  indicate that one should know\\nthat Lord Kåñëa is the supreme proprietor of the planetary systems of the\\nuniverse. He was existing before the creation, and He is different from His\\ncreation. All the demigods wer e created within this material world, but as far\\nas Kåñëa is concerned, it is said that  He is not created; therefore Kåñëa is\\ndifferent even from the great demigods  like Brahmä and Çiva. And because He\\nis the creator of Brahmä, Çiva and all the other demig ods, He is the Supreme\\nPerson of all planets.\\nÇré Kåñëa is therefore different from ev erything that is created, and anyone\\nwho knows Him as such immediately becomes liberated from all sinful\\nreactions. One must be liberated from all sinful activities to be in the\\nknowledge of the Supreme Lord. Only by  devotional service can He be known\\nand not by any other means, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä.\\nOne should not try to understand Kåñëa as a human being. As stated\\npreviously, only a foolish person thinks Him to be a human being. This is again\\nexpressed here in a different way. A ma n who is not foolish, who is intelligent\\nenough to understand the cons titutional position of the Godhead, is always\\nfree from all sinful reactions.\\nIf Kåñëa is known as the son of Deva ké, then how can He be unborn? That\\nis also explained in Çrémad-Bhägavatam : When He appeared before Devaké\\nand Vasudeva, He was not born as an ordinary child; He appeared in His\\noriginal form, and then He transformed Him self into an ordinary child.\\nAnything done under the direction of Kåñëa is transcendental. It cannot be\\ncontaminated by material reactions, wh ich may be auspicious or inauspicious.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.The conception that there are things auspicious and inauspicious in the\\nmaterial world is more or less a  mental concoction because there is nothing\\nauspicious in the material world. Everything is inauspicious because the very\\nmaterial nature is inauspicious. We simply imagine it to be auspicious. Real\\nauspiciousness depends on activities in Kåñëa consciousne ss in full devotion\\nand service. Therefore if we at all want our activities to be auspicious, then we\\nshould work under the directions of the Supreme Lord. Such directions are\\ngiven in authoritative scriptures such as Çrémad-Bhägavatam  and\\nBhagavad-gétä,  or from a bona fide spiritual master. Because the spiritual\\nmaster is the representative of the Supr eme Lord, his direction is directly the\\ndirection of the Supreme Lord. The sp iritual master, saintly persons and\\nscriptures direct in the same way. There is no contradiction in these three\\nsources. All actions done under such direction are free from the reactions of\\npious or impious activities of this mate rial world. The transcendental attitude\\nof the devotee in the performance of activities is actually that o f renunciation,\\nand this is called sannyäsa.  As stated in the first verse of the Sixth Chapter  of\\nBhagavad-gétä,  one who acts as a matter of duty because he has been ordered to\\ndo so by the Supreme Lord, and who does not seek shelter in the fruits of his\\nactivities ( anäçritaù karma-phalam ), is a true renouncer. Anyone acting under\\nthe direction of the Supreme Lord is actually a sannyäsé  and a yogé, and not the\\nman who has simply taken the dress of the sannyäsé,  or a pseudo yogé.\\nTEXTS  4–5\\nbuiÖjaRNaMaSaMMaaeh\" +aMaa SaTYa& dMa\" XaMa\" )\\nSau%& du\"%& >avae_>aavae >aYa& ca>aYaMaev c )) 4 ))\\nAih&Saa SaMaTaa TauiíSTaPaae daNa& YaXaae_YaXa\" )\\n>aviNTa >aava >aUTaaNaa& Mata Wv Pa*QaiGvDaa\" )) 5 ))\\nbuddhir jïänam asammohaù\\nkñamä satyaà damaù çamaù\\nsukhaà duùkhaà bhavo ’bhävoCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Ordinary knowledge obtained by a university education pertains only\\nto matter, and it is not accepted h ere as knowledge. Knowledge meansCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.knowing the distinction between spirit and matter. In modern education there\\nis no knowledge about spirit; they are simply taking care of the material\\nelements and bodily needs. Therefore academic knowledge is not complete .\\nAsammoha,  freedom from doubt and delusion, can be achieved when one is\\nnot hesitant and when he understands the transcendental philosophy. Slowly\\nbut surely he becomes free from bewi lderment. Nothing should be accepted\\nblindly; everything should be accepte d with care and with caution. Kñamä,\\ntolerance and forgiveness, should be pr acticed; one should be tolerant and\\nexcuse the minor offenses of others. Satyam,  truthfulness, means that facts\\nshould be presented as they are, for the benefit of others. Facts sh ould not be\\nmisrepresented. According to social conven tions, it is said that one can speak\\nthe truth only when it is palatable to others. But that is not truthfulness. The\\ntruth should be spoken in a straightforw ard way, so that others will understand\\nactually what the facts are. If a man is a thief and if people are warned that he\\nis a thief, that is truth. Although sometimes the truth is unpalatable, one\\nshould not refrain from speaking it. Truthfulness demands that the facts be\\npresented as they are for the benefit of others. That is the definition of truth.\\nControl of the senses means that th e senses should not be used for\\nunnecessary personal enjoyment. There is no prohibition against meeting the\\nproper needs of the senses, but unnecessa ry sense enjoyment is detrimental for\\nspiritual advancement. Therefore t he senses should be restrained from\\nunnecessary use. Similarly, one should  restrain the mind from unnecessary\\nthoughts; that is called çama.  One should not spend one’s time pondering over\\nearning money. That is a misuse of the thinking power. The mind shou ld be\\nused to understand the prime necessity  of human beings, and that should be\\npresented authoritatively. The power of thought should be developed in\\nassociation with persons who are authorit ies in the scriptures, saintly persons\\nand spiritual masters an d those whose thinking is highly developed. Sukham,\\npleasure or happiness, should always be in that which is favorable for the\\ncultivation of the spiritual knowledge of Kåñëa consciousness. And similarly,\\nthat which is painful or which causes distress is t hat which is unfavorable for\\nthe cultivation of Kåñëa consciousn ess. Anything favorable for the\\ndevelopment of Kåñëa consciousness should be accepted, and anythingCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.unfavorable should be rejected.\\nBhava,  birth, should be understood to refe r to the body. As far as the soul is\\nconcerned, there is neither birth nor de ath; that we have discussed in the\\nbeginning of Bhagavad-gétä.  Birth and death apply to one’s embodiment in the\\nmaterial world. Fear is d ue to worrying about the future. A person in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness has no fear because by his ac tivities he is sure to go back to the\\nspiritual sky, back home, back to Godhea d. Therefore his future is very bright.\\nOthers, however, do not know what their futu re holds; they have no\\nknowledge of what the next life hold s. So they are therefore in constant\\nanxiety. If we want to get free from anxiety, then the best course is to\\nunderstand Kåñëa and be situated always  in Kåñëa consciousness. In that way\\nwe will be free from all fear. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (11.2.37 ) it is stated,\\nbhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syät:  fear is caused by our absorption in the illusory\\nenergy. But those who are free from the illusory energy, those who are\\nconfident that they are not the ma terial body, that they are spiritual parts of\\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, and who are therefore engaged in the\\ntranscendental service of the Supreme Godhead, have nothing to fear. Their\\nfuture is very bright. This fear  is a condition of persons who  are not in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness. Abhayam,  fearlessness, is possible only for one in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness.\\nAhiàsä,  nonviolence, means that one sh ould not do anything which will\\nput others into misery or confusion. Mate rial activities that are promised by so\\nmany politicians, sociologists, philanth ropists, etc., do not produce very good\\nresults because the polit icians and philanthropists have no transcendental\\nvision; they do not know what is actually beneficial for human society. Ahiàsä\\nmeans that people should be trained in  such a way that the full utilization of\\nthe human body can be achieved. The human body i s meant for spiritual\\nrealization, so any movement or any commissions which do not further that\\nend commit violence on the human bo dy. That which furthers the future\\nspiritual happiness of the people in general is called nonviolence.\\nSamatä,  equanimity, refers to freedom from attachment and aversion. To be\\nvery much attached or to be very much  detached is not the best. This material\\nworld should be accepted without attachment or aversion. That which isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.favorable for prosecuting Kåñëa c onsciousness should be accepted; that which\\nis unfavorable should be rejected. That is called samatä,  equanimity. A person\\nin Kåñëa consciousness has nothing to reject and nothing to accept save in\\nterms of its usefulness in the prosecution of Kåñëa consci ousness.\\nTuñöi,  satisfaction, means that one should  not be eager to gather more and\\nmore material goods by unnecessary ac tivity. One should be satisfied with\\nwhatever is obtained by the grace of the Supreme Lord; that is called\\nsatisfaction. Tapas  means austerity o r penance. There are many rules and\\nregulations in the Vedas  which apply here, like rising early in the morning and\\ntaking a bath. Sometimes it is very tr oublesome to rise early in the morning,\\nbut whatever voluntary trouble on e may suffer in this way is c alled penance.\\nSimilarly, there are prescriptions for fast ing on certain days of the month. One\\nmay not be inclined to practice such fasting, but because of his determination\\nto make advancement in the science of Kåñëa consciousness, he should accept\\nsuch bodily troubles when they are recommended. However, one should not\\nfast unnecessarily or against Vedic inju nctions. One should not fast for some\\npolitical purpose; that is described in Bhagavad-gétä  as fasting in ignorance,\\nand anything done in ignorance o r passion does not lead to spiritual\\nadvancement. Everything done in th e mode of goodness does advance one,\\nhowever, and fasting done in terms of the Vedic injunctions enriches one in\\nspiritual knowledge.\\nAs far as charity is concerned, one sh ould give fifty percent of his earnings\\nto some good cause. And what is a good cause? It is that which is conducted in\\nterms of Kåñëa consciousness. That is not only a good cause, but the best cause.\\nBecause Kåñëa is g ood, His cause is also good. Thus charity should be given to a\\nperson who is engaged in Kåñëa consciousness. According to Vedic literature,\\nit is enjoined that charit y should be given to the brähmaëas.  This practice is\\nstill followed, although not very nic ely in terms of the Vedic injunction. But\\nstill the injunction is that ch arity should be given to the brähmaëas.  Why?\\nBecause they are engaged in higher cu ltivation of spiritual knowledge. A\\nbrähmaëa  is supposed to devote his whole life to understanding Br ahman.\\nBrahma jänätéti brähmaëaù:  one who knows Brahman is called a brähmaëa.\\nThus charity is offered to the brähmaëas  because they are always engaged inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.higher spiritual service and have no time  to earn their livelihood. In the Vedic\\nliterature, charity i s also to be awarded to one in the renounced order of life,\\nthe sannyäsé.  The sannyäsés  beg from door to door, not for money but for\\nmissionary purposes. The system is that they go from door to door to awaken\\nthe householders from the slumber of ignorance.  Because the householders are\\nengaged in family affairs and have forgotten their actual purpose in\\nlife—awakening their Kåñëa consciousness—it is the business of the sannyäsés\\nto go as beggars to the householde rs and encourage them to be Kåñëa\\nconscious. A s it is said in the Vedas,  one should awake and achieve what is due\\nhim in this human form of life. This knowledge and method is distributed by\\nthe sannyäsés;  hence charity is to be given to the renouncer of life, to the\\nbrähmaëas,  and similar good causes,  not to any whimsical cause.\\nYaças,  fame, should be according to Lord Caitanya, who said that a man is\\nfamous when he is known as a great de votee. That is real fame. If one has\\nbecome a great man in Kåñëa consciousness and it is known, then he is truly\\nfamous. One who does not have su ch fame is infamous.\\nAll these qualities are manifest throug hout the universe in human society\\nand in the society of the demigods. There are many forms of humanity on\\nother planets, and these qualities ar e there. Now, for one who wants to\\nadvance in Kåñëa consciousness, Kåñëa creates all these qualities, but the\\nperson develops them himself from wi thin. One who engages in the devotional\\nservice of the Supreme Lord develops all the good qualities, as arranged by the\\nSupreme Lord.\\nOf whatever we find, good or bad, the origin is Kåñëa. Nothing can\\nmanifest itself in this material world wh ich is not in Kåñëa. That is knowledge;\\nalthough we know that things are diffe rently situated, we should realize that\\neverything flows from Kåñëa.\\nTEXT  6\\nMahzRYa\" Saá PaUveR cTvarae MaNavSTaQaa )\\nMaÙava MaaNaSaa JaaTaa Yaeza& l/aek- wMaa\" Pa[Jaa\" )) 6 ))Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The wise who perfectly know this engage in My devotional service\\nand worship Me with all their hearts.\\nPURPORT\\nA learned scholar who has studied the Vedas  perfectly and has information\\nfrom authorities like Lord Caitanya  and who knows how to apply these\\nteachings can understand that Kåñëa is the origin of everything in both the\\nmaterial and spiritual worlds, and be cause he knows this perfectly he becomes\\nfirmly fixed in the devotional servic e of the Supreme Lord. He can never be\\ndeviated by any amount of nonsensical commentaries or by fools. All Vedic\\nliterature agrees that Kåñëa is the source of Brahmä, Çiva and al l other\\ndemigods. In the Atharva Veda  (Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad  1.24) it is said, yo\\nbrahmäëaà vidadhäti pürvaà yo vai vedäàç ca gäpayati sma kåñëaù:  “It was\\nKåñëa who in the beginning instructed  Brahmä in Vedic knowledge and who\\ndisseminated Vedic knowledge  in the past.” Then again the Näräyaëa\\nUpaniñad  (1) says, atha puruño ha vai näräyaëo ’kämayata prajäù såjeyeti:  “Then\\nthe Supreme Personality Näräyaëa desire d to create living entities.” The\\nUpaniñad  continues, näräyaëäd brahmä jäyate, näräyaëäd prajäpati ù prajäyate,\\nnäräyaëäd indro jäyate, näräyaëäd añöau vasavo jäyante, näräyaëäd ekädaça\\nrudrä jäyante, näräyaëäd dvädaçädityäù:  “From Näräyaëa, Brahmä is born, and\\nfrom Näräyaëa the patriarchs are also born. From Näräyaëa, Indra is born,\\nfrom Näräyaëa the e ight Vasus are born, from Närä yaëa the eleven Rudras are\\nborn, from Näräyaëa the twelve Ädit yas are born.” This Näräyaëa is an\\nexpansion of Kåñëa.\\nIt is said in the same Vedas,  brahmaëyo devaké-putraù:  “The son of Devaké,\\nKåñëa, is the Supreme Personality.” ( Näräyaëa Upaniñad  4) Then it is said, eko\\nvai näräyaëa äsén na brahmä na éçäno näpo nägni-samau neme dyäv-äpåthivé na\\nnakñaträëi na süryaù:  “In the beginning of the creation there was only the\\nSupreme Personality Näräyaëa.

Thus the Vedas  say that it is the Supreme Lord, the creator of\\nBrahmä and Çiva, who is to be worshiped.\\nIn the Mokña-dharma  Kåñëa also says,\\nprajäpatià ca rudraà cäpy\\naham eva såjämi vai\\ntau hi mäà na vijänéto\\nmama mäyä-vimohitau\\n“The patriarchs, Çiva and others are created by Me, though they do not\\nknow that they are created by Me because they are deluded by My illusory\\nenergy.” In the Varäha Puräëa  it is also said,\\nnäräyaëaù paro devas\\ntasmäj jätaç caturmukhaù\\ntasmäd rudro ’bhavad devaù\\nsa ca sarva-jïatäà gataù\\n“Näräyaëa is the Supreme Personalit y of Godhead, and from Him Brahmä\\nwas born, from whom Çiva was born.”\\nLord Kåñëa is the source of all ge nerations, and He is called the most\\nefficient cause of everything. He says,  “Because everything is born of Me, I am\\nthe original source of all. Everything is under Me; no one is above Me.” There\\nis no supreme controller o ther than Kåñëa. One who understands Kåñëa in\\nsuch a way from a bona fide spiritual master, with references from Vedic\\nliterature, engages all his energy in Kåñëa consciousness and becomes a truly\\nlearned man. In comparison to him, all others, who do not k now Kåñëa\\nproperly, are but fools. Only a fool would consider Kåñëa to be an ordinary\\nman.

Once situated in that transcendental\\nposition, they can relish the highest pe rfection which is exhibited by the Lord\\nin His abode. Lord Caitanya likens tr anscendental devotional service to the\\nsowing of a seed in the heart of the li ving entity. There are innumerable living\\nentities traveling throughout the different planets of the universe, and out of\\nthem there are a few who are fortunate en ough to meet a pure devotee and get\\nthe chance to understand devotional se rvice. This devotional service is just\\nlike a seed, and if it is sown in the he art of a living entity, and if he goes on\\nhearing and chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare\\nRäma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, that seed fructifies, just as the seed\\nof a tree fructifies with regular watering. The spiritual plant of devotional\\nservice gradually grows a nd grows until it penetrates the covering of the\\nmaterial universe and enters into the brahmajyoti  effulgence in the spiritual\\nsky. In the spiritual sky also that plan t grows more and more until it reaches\\nthe highest planet, which is called Goloka Våndäva na, the supreme planet of\\nKåñëa. Ultimately, the plant takes shel ter under the lotus feet of Kåñëa and\\nrests there. Gradually, as a plant grow s fruits and flowers, that plant of\\ndevotional service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of\\nchanting and hearing goes on. This plant of devotional service is fully\\ndescribed in the Caitanya-caritämåta  (Madhya-lélä,  Chapter Nineteen ). It is\\nexplained there that when the complete  plant takes shelter under the lotus\\nfeet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed in love of God; then he\\ncannot live even for a moment without being in contact with the Supreme\\nLord, just as a fish cannot live without water. In such a state, the devotee\\nactually attains the transcendental qualities in contact wit h the Supreme Lord.\\nThe Çrémad-Bhägavatam  is also full of such narrations about the\\nrelationship between the Supreme Lord and His devotees ; therefore the\\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam  is very dear to the devotees, as stated in the Bhägavatam\\nitself ( 12.13.18 ).

We may remember\\nthat in the Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He had\\nspoken to him of many things and that  He would instruct him in the way of\\nbuddhi-yoga.  Now buddhi-yoga  is exp lained. Buddhi-yoga  itself is action in\\nKåñëa consciousness; that is the highest intelligence. Buddhi  means\\nintelligence, and yoga means mystic activities or mystic elevation. When oneCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

In other words,\\nbuddhi-yoga  is the process by which one gets  out of the entanglement of this\\nmaterial world. The ultimate goal of progress is Kåñëa. People do not know\\nthis; therefore the ass ociation of devotees and a bona fide spiritual master are\\nimportant. One should know that the goal is Kåñëa, and when the goal is\\nassigned, then the path is slowly but progressively traversed, and the ultimate\\ngoal is achieved.\\nWhen a person knows the goal of life  but is addicted to the fruits of\\nactivities, he is acting in karma-yoga.  When he knows that the goal is Kåñëa\\nbut he takes pleasure in mental speculat ions to understand Kåñëa, he is acting\\nin jïäna-yoga.  A n d  w h e n  h e  k n o ws the goal and seeks Kåñëa completely in\\nKåñëa consciousness and devotional service, he is acting in bhakti-yoga,  or\\nbuddhi-yoga,  which is the complete yoga.  This complete yoga is the highest\\nperfectional stage of life.\\nA person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a\\nspiritual organization, but still, if he is  not intelligent enough to make progress,\\nthen Kåñëa from within gives him instructions so that he may ultimately come\\nto Him without difficu lty. The qualification is that a person always engage\\nhimself in Kåñëa consciousness and with love and devotion render all kinds of\\nservices. He should perform some sort of work for Kåñëa, and that work should\\nbe with love. If a devotee is not intelligent enough to make progress on the\\npath of self-realization but is sincere and devoted to the activities of\\ndevotional service, the Lord gives him a chance to make progress and\\nultimately attain to Him.\\nTEXT  11\\nTaezaMaevaNauk-MPaaQaRMahMajaNaJa& TaMa\" )\\nNaaXaYaaMYaaTMa>aavSQaae jaNadqPaeNa >aaSvTaa )) 11 ))\\nteñäm evänukampärtham\\naham ajïäna-jaà tamaùCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

But even if a devotee does not take\\nadvantage of their literatures or of his sp iritual master, if he is sincere in his\\ndevotional service he is he lped by Kåñëa Himself within his heart.

Man\\ncan go on speculating for several millions of years, and if he is not devoted, if\\nhe is not a lover of the Supreme Truth, he will never understand Kåñëa, or the\\nSupreme Truth. Only by devotional service i s the Supreme Truth, Kåñëa,\\npleased, and by His inconceivable energy  He can reveal Himself to the heart of\\nthe pure devotee. The pure devotee always has Kåñëa within his heart; and\\nwith the presence of Kåñëa, who is just like the sun, the darkness of ignor ance\\nis at once dissipated. This is the spec ial mercy rendered to the pure devotee by\\nKåñëa.\\nDue to the contamination of material association, through many, many\\nmillions of births, one’s heart is always  covered with the dust of materialism,\\nbut when one engages in devotional serv ice and constantly chants Hare Kåñëa,\\nthe dust quickly clears, and o ne is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge.\\nThe ultimate goal, Viñëu, can be attained only by this chant and by devotional\\nservice, and not by mental speculation or argument.

Arjuna, after hearing the essential four verses of Bhagavad-gétä\\n[BG. 10.8-11]  in this chapter, beca me completely free from all doubts and\\naccepted Kåñëa as the Supreme Personal ity of Godhead. He at once boldly\\ndeclares, “You are paraà brahma,  the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” And\\npreviously Kåñëa stated that He is the originator of everything and eve ryone.\\nEvery demigod and every human being is dependent on Him. Men and\\ndemigods, out of ignorance, think that  they are absolute and independent of\\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. That ignorance is removed perfectly by\\nthe discharge of devotional servi ce. This has already been explained in the\\nprevious verse by the Lord. Now, by His grace, Arjuna is accepting Him as the\\nSupreme Truth, in concordance with the Vedic injunction. It is not that\\nbecause Kåñëa is Arjuna’s intimate friend Arjuna is flattering Him by calling\\nHim the Supreme Personality of Godh ead, the Absolute Truth. Whatever\\nArjuna says in these two verses is conf irmed by Vedic truth. Vedic injunctions\\naffirm that only one who takes to devo tional service to the Supreme Lord can\\nunderstand Him, whereas others cannot. Each and every word of this verse\\nspoken by Arjuna is confirmed by Vedic injunction.\\nIn the Kena Upaniñad  it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest for\\neverything, and Kåñëa has already explained that everything is resting  on Him.\\nThe Muëòaka Upaniñad  confirms that the Supreme Lord, in whom everything\\nis resting, can be realized on ly by those who engage constantly  in thinking of\\nHim. This constant thinking of Kåñëa is smaraëam,  one of the methods  of\\ndevotional service. It is only by de votional service to Kåñëa that one can\\nunderstand his position and get rid of this material body .\\nIn the Vedas  the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure. One\\nwho understands that Kåñëa is the purest of the pure  can become purified from\\nall sinful activities. One cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he\\nsurrenders  unto the Sup reme Lord. Arjuna’s acceptance of Kåñëa as the\\nsupreme pure complies with the injunctions of Vedic literature. This is alsoCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.confirmed by great personalities, of whom Närada  is the chief.\\nKåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should always\\nmeditate upon Him and enjoy one’s tran scendental relationship with Him. He\\nis the supreme existence. He is free fr om bodily needs, birth and death. Not\\nonly does Arjuna confirm this, but al l the Vedic literatures, the Puräëas  and\\nhistories. In all Vedic literatures Kåñë a is thus described, and the Supreme\\nLord Himself also says in the Fourth Chapter , “Although I am unborn, I appear\\non this earth to establish religious principles. ” He is the supreme origin; He has\\nno cause, for He is the cause of all causes, and everything is emanating from\\nHim. This perfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the Supreme Lord.\\nHere Arjuna expresses himself through t h e  g r a c e  o f  K å ñ ë a .  I f  w e  w a n t  t o\\nunderstand Bhagavad-gétä,  we should accept the statements in these two\\nverses. This is called the paramparä  system, acceptance of the disciplic\\nsuccession. Unless one is in the discipl ic succession, he cannot understand\\nBhagavad-gétä.  It is not possible by so-called academic education.\\nUnfortunately those proud of their ac ademic education, despite so much\\nevidence in Vedic literatures, stick to their obstinate conviction that Kåñëa is\\nan ordinary person .\\nTEXT  14\\nSavRMaeTad*Ta& MaNYae YaNMaa& vdiSa ke-Xav )\\nNa ih Tae >aGavNVYai¢&- ivdudeRva Na daNava\" )) 14 ))\\nsarvam etad åtaà manye\\nyan mäà vadasi keçava\\nna hi te bhagavan vyaktià\\nvidur devä na dänaväù\\nSYNONYMS\\nsarvam —all; etat—this; åtam —truth; manye —I accept; yat—which;\\nmäm —unto me; vadasi —You tell; keçava —O Kåñëa; na—never; hi—certainly;Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

He is not kn own even by the demigods, so what to\\nspeak of the so-called scholars of this  modern world? By the grace of the\\nSupreme Lord, Arjuna has understood that  the Supreme Truth is Kåñëa and\\nthat He is the perfect one. One should  therefore follow the path of Arjuna. He\\nreceived the authority of Bhagavad-gétä.  As described in the Fourth Chapter,\\nthe paramparä  system of disciplic succession for the understanding o f\\nBhagavad-gétä  was lost , and therefore Kåñëa reestablished that disciplic\\nsuccession with Arjuna because He considered Arjuna His intimate friend and\\na great devotee. Therefore, as stated in our Introduction to Gétopaniñad,\\nBhagavad-gétä  s h o u l d  b e  u n d e r s t ood in the paramparä  system. When the\\nparamparä  system was lost, Arjuna was selected to rejuvenate it. The\\nacceptance by Arjuna of all that Kåñëa says should be emulated; then we can\\nunderstand the essence of Bhagavad-gétä,  and then only can we understand\\nthat Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\\nTEXT  15\\nSvYaMaevaTMaNaaTMaaNa& veTQa Tv& PauåzaetaMa )\\n>aUTa>aavNa >aUTaeXa devdev JaGaTPaTae )) 15 ))\\nsvayam evätmanätmänaà\\nvettha tvaà puruñottama\\nbhüta-bhävana bhüteçaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Persons of demonic or atheistic mentality cannot know\\nKåñëa. Mental speculation that leads one a way from the Supreme Lord is a\\nserious sin, and one who does not know  Kåñëa should not try to comment on\\nBhagavad-gétä.  Bhagavad-gétä  is the statement of Kåñë a, and since it is the\\nscience of Kåñëa, it should be understood from Kåñëa as Arjuna understood i t.\\nIt should not be received from atheistic persons.\\nAs stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.2.11 ):\\nvadanti tat tattva-vidas\\ntattvaà yaj jïänam advayam\\nbrahmeti paramätmeti\\nbhagavän iti çabdyate\\nThe Supreme Truth is realized in th ree aspects: as impersonal Brahman,\\nlocalized Paramätmä and at last as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So at\\nthe last stage of understanding the Abso lute Truth, one comes to the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead. A commo n man or even a liberated man who hasCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.realized impersonal Brahman or localized Paramätmä may not understand\\nGod’s personality. Such men, therefor e, may endeavor to understand the\\nSupreme Person from the verses of Bhagavad-gétä,  which are being spoken by\\nthis person, Kåñëa. Sometimes the impers onalists accept Kåñëa as Bhagavän, or\\nthey accept His authority. Yet many liberated persons cannot understand\\nKåñëa as Puruñottama, the Supreme Person. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him\\nas Puruñottama. Yet one still may n ot understand that Kåñëa is the father of all\\nliving entities. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as Bhüta-bhävana . And if one\\ncomes to know Him as the father of all the living entities, still one may not\\nknow Him as the supreme controller; therefore He is add ressed here as\\nBhüteça , the supreme controller of everyone. And even if one knows Kåñëa as\\nthe supreme controller of all living enti ties, still one may not know that He is\\nthe origin of all the demigods; therefore He is addressed herein as Devadeva ,\\nthe wo rshipful God of all demigods. And even if one knows Him as the\\nworshipful God of all demigods, one ma y not know that He is the supreme\\nproprietor of everything; therefore He is addressed as Jagatpati.

By Kåñëa’s\\ngrace, Arjuna has personal experience, intelligence and knowledge and\\nwhatever else a person may have through all thes e agencies, and he has\\nunderstood Kåñëa to be the Supreme Pe rsonality of Godhead. For him there is\\nno doubt, yet he is asking Kåñëa to explain His all-pervading  nature. People in\\ngeneral and the impersonalists in particular concern themselves mainly with\\nthe all-pervading nature of the Supreme. So Arjuna is asking Kåñëa how He\\nexists in His all-pervading aspect th rough His different energies.

In what various forms are You to be remembered, O\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead?\\nPURPORT\\nAs it is stated in the previous chap ter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead\\nis covered by His yoga-mäyä . Only surrendered souls and devotees can see\\nHim. Now Arjuna is convinced that His friend, Kåñëa, is the Supreme\\nGodhead, but he wants to know the gener al process by which the all-pervading\\nLord can be understood by the common man. Common men , including the\\ndemons and atheists, cannot know Kåñëa, because He is guarded by His\\nyoga-mäyä  energy. Again, these questions are asked by Arjuna for their\\nbenefit. T he superior devotee is concerned not only for his own understanding\\nbut for the understanding of all mankind.  So Arjuna, out of his mercy, because\\nhe is a Vaiñëava, a devotee, is open ing for the common man the understanding\\nof the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme Lord. He addresses Kåñëa specifically\\nas yogin  because Çré Kåñëa is the master of the yoga-mäyä  energy, by which He\\nis covered and uncovered to the common man. The common man who has no\\nlove for Kåñëa cannot always thin k of Kåñëa; therefore he has to think\\nmaterially. Arjuna is considering the mo de of thinking of the materialistic\\npersons of this world. The words keñu keñu ca bhäveñu  refer to material nature\\n(the word bhäva  means “physical things”). Because materialists cannot\\nunderstand Kåñëa spiri tually, they are advised to concentrate the mind on\\nphysical things and try to see how Kåñëa is manifested by physical\\nrepresentations.\\nTEXT  18Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

And this nectar can be perceived by\\npractical experience. Modern stories, fiction and histories are different from\\nthe transcendental pastimes of t he Lord in that one will tire of hearing\\nmundane stories but one never tires of hearing about Kåñëa . It is for this\\nreason only that the history of the whol e universe is replete with references to\\nthe pastimes of the incarnations of Godhead.

Rather, the very topics of Kåñëa are\\nso relishable that they appear to the devotees as nectar . Thus the devotees\\nenjoy them. In discussing Kåñëa’s opulences a nd His diverse energies, the pure\\ndevotees take transcendental pleasure. Therefore they want to hear and\\ndiscuss  them. Kåñëa knows that living entiti es do not understand the extent of\\nHis opulences; He therefore agrees to  state only the principal manifesta tions of\\nHis different energies. The word prädhänyataù  (“principal”) is very important\\nbecause we can understand only a few of  the principal details of the Supreme\\nLord, for His features are unlimited . It is not possible to understand them all.\\nAnd vibhüti , as used in this verse, refers to the opulences  by which He controls\\nthe whole manifestation.

When Mahä-Viñëu enters i nto the manifested\\nuniverses, He again manifests Himself as the Supersoul in each and every\\nentity. We have experience that the personal body of the living entity exists\\ndue to the presence of the spiritual spark. Without the existence of the\\nspiritual spa rk, the body cannot develop. Similarly, the material manifestation\\ncannot develop unless the Supreme Soul, Kåñëa, enters.

But\\nworship of demigods is thoroughly discouraged herein because even theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

If, however, one\\nthoroughly studies the different descri ptions of the opulences and expansions\\nof Kåñëa’s energy, then one  can understand without any doubt the position of\\nLord Çré Kåñëa and can fix his mind  in the worship of Kåñëa without\\ndeviation. The Lord is all-pervad ing by the expansion of His partial\\nrepresentation, the Supersoul, who en ters into everything that is.

Kåñëa is not an\\nincarnation; He is the source of all incarnations. That has been completely\\nexplained in the last chapt er.\\nNow, as far as Arjuna is concerned, he says that his illusion is over. This\\nmeans that Arjuna no longer thinks of  Kåñëa as a mere human being, as a\\nfriend of his, but as the source of everything. Arjuna is very enlightened and is\\nglad that he has such a gr eat friend as Kåñëa, but now he is thinking that\\nalthough he may accept Kåñëa as the source of everything, others may not. So\\nin order to establish Kåñëa’s divinity fo r all, he is requesting Kåñëa in this\\nchapter to show His universal form. Actually when o ne sees the universal form\\nof Kåñëa one becomes frightened, like Arjuna, but Kåñëa is so kind that after\\nshowing it He converts Himself again in to His original form. Arjuna agrees to\\nwhat Kåñëa has several times said: Kåñëa is speaking to him just for his benefit.\\nSo Arjuna acknowledges that all this is happening to him by Kåñëa’s grace.

Every living  entity is only a spiritual spark; therefore it is\\nnot possible to see or to understand the Supreme Lord. Arjuna, as a devotee,\\ndoes not depend on his speculative strength; rather, he admits his limitations\\nas a living entity and acknowledges Kåñëa’s inest imable position. Arjuna could\\nunderstand that for a living entity it is not possible to understand the\\nunlimited infinite. If the infinite reveals Himself, then it is possible to\\nunderstand the nature of the infinite by the grace of the infinite.

The whole world is moving according to the plan of the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. Foolis h persons who do not have sufficient\\nknowledge think that nature is moving  without a plan and all manifestations\\nare but accidental formations. There are many so-calle d scientists who suggest\\nthat perhaps it was like this, or maybe like that, but there is no question of\\n“perhaps” and “maybe.” There is a spec ific plan being carried out in this\\nmaterial world. What is this plan? This  cosmic manifestation is a chance for\\nthe conditioned souls to go back to Go dhead, back to home. As long as they\\nhave the domineering mentality which make s them try to lord it over material\\nnature, they are conditioned. But anyone  who can understand the plan of the\\nSupreme Lord and cultivate Kå ñëa consciousness is most intelligent. The\\ncreation and destruction of the cosmic  manifestation are under the superior\\nguidance of God. Thus the Battle of Kurukñetra was fought according to the\\nplan of God. Arjuna was refusing  to fight, but he was told tha t he should fight\\nin accordance with the desire of the Supreme Lord.

He is the shelter of the whole\\nuniverse. Arjuna also thought that it was fitting tha t all the perfect living\\nentities and powerful demigods offer their respectful obeisances unto Him,\\nbecause no one is greater than Him. Arjuna especially mentions that Kåñëa is\\ngreater than Brahmä because Brahmä is created by Him. Brahmä is born out of\\nthe lotus stem grown from the navel ab domen of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, who\\nis Kåñëa’s plenary expansion; therefore Brahmä and Lord Çiva, who is born of\\nBrahmä, and all other demigods must o ffer their respectful obeisances. It is\\nstated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  that  the Lord is respected by Lord Çiva and\\nBrahmä and similar other demigods. The word akñaram  is very significant\\nbecause this material creation is subjec t to destruction but the Lord is above\\nthis material creation. He is the cause of all causes, and being so, He is superior\\nto all the conditioned souls within this material nature as well as the material\\ncosmic manifestation itself.

This is stated in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (6.8):\\nna tasya käryaà karaëaà ca vidyate\\nna tat-samaç cäbhyadhikaç ca dåçyate\\nThe Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, has senses and a body like the ordinary man, but\\nfor Him there is no difference between His senses, His body, His mind and\\nHimself. Foolish persons who do not perfectly know Him say that Kåñëa is\\ndifferent from His soul, mind, hear t and everything else. Kåñëa is absolute;\\ntherefore His activities and potencies are supreme. It is also stated thatCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

No one can\\nbe greater than Him, no one can be eq ual to Him, and everyone is lower than\\nHim.\\nThe knowledge, strength and activities  of the Supreme Personality are all\\ntranscendental. As stated in Bhagavad-gétä  (4.9):\\njanma karma ca me divyam\\nevaà yo vetti tattvataù\\ntyaktvä dehaà punar janma\\nnaiti mäm eti so ’rjuna\\nWhoever knows Kåñëa’s transcendental body, activities and perfection,\\nafter quitting his body, returns to Hi m and doesn’t come back again to this\\nmiserable world. Therefore one should know that Kåñëa’s activities are\\ndifferent from others. The best policy is to follow the principles of Kåñëa; that\\nwill make one perfect. It is also stated  that there is no one who is master of\\nKåñëa; everyone is His servant. The Caitanya-caritämåta  (Ädi 5.142 ) confirms,\\nekale éçvara kåñëa, ära saba bhåtya:  only Kåñëa is God, and everyone else is His\\nservant. Everyone is complying with His order.

Who\\ncan have divine vision? Divine means godly. Unless one attains the status of\\ndivinity as a demigod, he cannot have divine vision. And what is a demigod? It\\nis stated in the Vedic script ures that those who are devotees of Lord Viñëu are\\ndemigods ( viñëu-bhaktäù småtä deväù ). Those who are atheistic, i.e., who do not\\nbelieve in Viñëu, or who recognize only  the impersonal part of Kåñëa as the\\nSupreme, cannot have the divine vision. It is not  possible to decry Kåñëa and\\nat the same time have the divine vi sion. One cannot have the divine vision\\nwithout becoming divine. In other word s, those who have divine vision can\\nalso see like Arjuna.\\nThe Bhagavad-gétä  gives the description of the universal form. Although\\nthis description was unknown to everyone before Arjuna, now one can have\\nsome idea of the viçva-rüpa  after this incident. Those who are actually divine\\ncan see the universal form of th e Lord. But one cannot be divine without\\nbeing a pure devotee of Kåñëa. The devotees, however, who are actually in the\\ndivine nature and who have divine vi sion, are not very much interested in\\nseeing the universal form of th e Lord. As described in the prev ious verse,\\nArjuna desired to see the four-handed form of Lord Kåñëa as Viñëu, and heCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.was actually afraid of the universal form.\\nIn this verse there are some significant words, just like\\nveda-yajïädhyayanaiù,  which refers to studying Vedic literature and the\\nsubject matter of sacrificial regulations. Veda  refers to all kinds of Vedic\\nliterature, such as the four Vedas  (Åg, Yajur, Sä ma and Atharva ) and the\\neighteen Puräëas,  the Upaniñads  and the Vedänta-sütra.  One can study these\\nat home or anywhere else. Similarly, there are sütras—Kalpa-sütras  and\\nMémäàsä-sütras —for studying the method of sacrifice. Dänaiù  refers to\\ncharity which is  offered to a suitable party, such as those who are engaged in\\nthe transcendental loving service of the Lord—the brähmaëas  and the\\nVaiñëavas. Similarly, “pious activities” refers to the agni-hotra  and the\\nprescribed duties of the different castes. And the voluntary acceptance of\\nsome bodily pains is called tapasya.  So one can perform all these—can accept\\nbodily penances, give charity, study the Vedas,  etc.—but unless he is a devotee\\nlike Arjuna, it is not possible to s ee that universal form. Those who are\\nimpersonalists are also imagining that they  are seeing the universal form of the\\nLord, but from Bhagavad-gétä  we understand that the impersonalists are not\\ndevotees. Therefore they are unable to see the universal form of the Lord.\\nThere are many persons who create incarnations. They falsely claim an\\nordinary human to be an incarnation, but this is all foolishness. We should\\nfollow the principles of Bhagavad-gétä,  otherwise there is no possibility of\\nattaining perfect spiritual knowl edge. Although Bhagavad-gétä  is considered\\nthe preliminary study of the science of God,  still it is so perfect that it enables\\none to distinguish what is what. The fo llowers of a pseudo incarnation may say\\nthat they have also seen the transcendental incarn ation of God, the universal\\nform, but that is unacceptable because it  is clearly stated here that unless one\\nbecomes a devotee of Kåñëa one cannot s ee the universal form of God. So one\\nfirst of all has to become a pure de votee of Kåñëa; then he can claim t hat he\\ncan show the universal form of what he has seen. A devotee of Kåñëa cannot\\naccept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations.\\nTEXT  49Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

One may be able to see the universal form of Kåñëa by adding a\\nlittle tinge of devotional service to vari ous activities like penances, Vedic study\\nand philosophical speculation. It may be possible, but wi thout a tinge of bhakti\\none cannot see; that has already been ex plained. Still, beyond that universal\\nform, the form of Kåñëa with two hands is still more difficult to see, even for\\ndemigods like Brahmä and Lord Çiva. They desire to see Him, and we have\\nevidence in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  that when He was supposed to be in the\\nwomb of His mother, Devaké, all the de migods from heaven came to see the\\nmarvel of Kåñëa, and they offered nice  prayers to the Lord, although He was\\nnot at that time visible to them. Th ey waited to see Him. A foolish person may\\nderide Him, thinking Him an ordinary person, and may offer respect not to\\nHim but to the impersonal “somethi ng” within Him, but these are all\\nnonsensical postures. Kåñëa in His two-armed form is actually desired t o beCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.seen by demigods like Brahmä and Çiva.\\nIn Bhagavad-gétä  (9.11) it is also confirmed, avajänanti mäà müòhä mänuñéà\\ntanum äçritaù:  He is not visible to the foolish persons who deride Him. Kåñëa’s\\nbody, as confirmed by Brahma-saàhitä  and confirmed by Kåñëa Himself in\\nBhagavad-gétä,  is completely s piritual and full of bliss and eternality. His body\\nis never like a material body. But fo r some who make a study of Kåñëa by\\nreading Bhagavad-gétä  or similar Vedic scriptures, Kåñëa is a problem. For one\\nusing a material process, Kåñëa is considered to be a great historical personality\\nand very learned philosopher, but He is an ordinary man, and even though He\\nwas so powerful He had to accept a ma terial body. Ultimately they think that\\nthe Absolute Truth is impersonal; th erefore they think that from His\\nimpersonal feature He assumed a personal feature attached to material nature.\\nThis is a materialistic calculation of the Supreme Lord. Another calculation is\\nspeculative. Those who are in search of  knowledge also speculate on Kåñëa and\\nconsider Him to be less  important than the universal form of the Supreme.\\nThus some think that the universal fo rm of Kåñëa which was manifested to\\nArjuna is more important than His pe rsonal form. According to them, the\\npersonal form of the Supreme is  something imaginary. They be lieve that in the\\nultimate issue, the Absolute Truth is  not a person. But the transcendental\\nprocess is described in Bhagavad-gétä,  Chapter Four:  to hear about Kåñëa from\\nauthorities. That is the actual Vedic pr ocess, and those who are actually in the\\nVedi c line hear about Kåñëa from authority, and by repeated hearing about\\nHim, Kåñëa becomes dear. As we have several times discussed, Kåñëa is covered\\nby His yoga-mäyä  potency. He is not to be s een or revealed to anyone and\\neveryone. Only by one to whom He re veals Himself can He be seen. This is\\nconfirmed in Vedic literature; for one who is a surrendered soul, the Absolute\\nTruth can actually be understood. The transcendentalist, by continuous Kåñëa\\nconsciousness and by devotional service to Kåñëa, can have his  spiritual eyes\\nopened and can see Kåñëa by revelation.

No one can understandCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Kåñëa or how He came from parents in a four-handed form and at once\\nchanged Himself into a two-handed form . These things are very difficult to\\nunderstand by study of the Vedas  or by philosophical speculation. Therefore it\\nis clearly stated here that no one ca n see Him or enter into understanding of\\nthese matters. Those who, however, are very experienced students of Vedic\\nliterature can learn about Him from th e Vedic literature in so many ways.\\nThere are so many rules and r egulations, and if one at all wants to understand\\nKåñëa, he must follow the regulative pr inciples described in the authoritative\\nliterature. One can perform penance in accordance with those principles. For\\nexample, to undergo serious penances one may obser ve fasting on Janmäñöamé,\\nthe day on which Kåñëa appeared, an d on the two days of Ekädaçé (the\\neleventh day after the new moon and the eleventh day after the full moon).\\nAs far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity should be given to the\\ndevote es of Kåñëa who are engaged in His devotional service to spread the\\nKåñëa philosophy, or Kåñëa consciousn ess, throughout the world. Kåñëa\\nconsciousness is a benediction to huma nity. Lord Caitanya was appreciated by\\nRüpa Gosvämé as the most munificent man o f charity because love of Kåñëa,\\nwhich is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. So if one gives\\nsome amount of his money to person s involved in distributing Kåñëa\\nconsciousness, that charity, given to  spread Kåñëa consciousness, is the greatest\\ncharity in the world. And if one worships  as prescribed in the temple (in the\\ntemples in India there is always some st atue, usually of Viñëu or Kåñëa), that is\\na chance to progress by offering worship and respect to the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godh ead. For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord,\\ntemple worship is essential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature\\n(Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  6.23):\\nyasya deve parä bhaktir\\nyathä deve tathä gurau\\ntasyaite kathitä hy arthäù\\nprakäçante mahätmanaù\\n [ÇU 6.23(881) ]\\nOne who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed byCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.the spiritual master, in whom he has similar unflinching faith, can see the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead by re velation. One cannot understand Kåñëa\\nby mental speculation. For one wh o does not take personal training under the\\nguidance of a bona fide spiritual mast er, it is impossible to even begin to\\nunderstand Kåñëa. The word tu is specifically used here to indicate that no\\nother process can be used, can be recommended, or can be suc cessful in\\nunderstanding Kåñëa.\\nThe personal forms of Kåñëa, the tw o-handed form and the four-handed,\\nare completely different from the temp orary universal form shown to Arjuna.\\nThe four-handed form of Näräyaëa an d the two-handed form of Kåñëa are\\neternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is\\ntemporary. The very word sudurdarçam,  meaning “difficult to see,” suggests\\nthat no one had seen that universal fo rm. It also suggests that amongst the\\ndevotees there was no necessity of  showing it. That form was exhibi ted by\\nKåñëa at the request of Arjuna so th at in the future, when one represents\\nhimself as an incarnation of God, people can ask to see his universal form.\\nThe word na, used repeatedly in the previous verse, indicates that one\\nshould not be very much proud of such credentials as an academic education in\\nVedic literature. One must take to the devotional service of Kåñëa. Only then\\ncan one attempt to write comm entaries on Bhagavad-gétä.\\nKåñëa changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of\\nNäräyaëa and then to His own natural fo rm of two hands. This indicates that\\nthe four-handed forms and other forms me ntioned in Vedic literature are all\\nemanations of the original two-handed K åñëa. He is the origin of all\\nemanations. Kåñëa is distinct even from  these forms, what to speak of the\\nimpersonal conception. As far as the four-handed forms of Kåñëa are\\nconcerned, it is stated clearly that ev en the most identical four-handed form of\\nKåñëa (which is known as Mahä-Viñëu, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and\\nfrom whose breathing so many innume rable universes are passing out and\\nentering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord. As stated in the\\nBrahma-saàhitä  (5.48),\\nyasyaika-niçvasita-kälam athävalambya\\njévanti loma-vila-jä jagad-aëòa-näthäùCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Therefore I worship Govinda, Kåñëa, the cause of all\\ncauses.” Therefore one should conclusi vely worship the personal form of Kåñëa\\nas the Supreme Personality of Godhea d who has eternal bliss and knowledge.\\nHe is the source of all forms of Viñë u ,  H e  i s  t h e  s o u r c e  o f  a l l  f o r m s  o f\\nincarnation, and He is the original  Supreme Personality, as confirme d in\\nBhagavad-gétä.\\nIn the Vedic literature ( Gopäla-täpané Upaniñad  1.1) the following statement\\nappears:\\nsac-cid-änanda-rüpäya\\nkåñëäyäkliñöa-käriëe\\nnamo vedänta-vedyäya\\ngurave buddhi-säkñiëe\\n“I offer my respectful obeisances unto Kåñëa, who has a transcendental\\nform of bliss, eternity and knowledge.

He is the cause of all causes.”\\nElsewhere it is said, yaträvatérëaà kåñëäkhyaà paraà brahma naräkåti:  “The\\nSupreme Absolute Truth is a person, Hi s name is Kåñëa, and He sometimes\\ndescends on this earth.” Similarly, in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  w e  f i n d  a\\ndescription of all kinds of incarnatio ns of the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead, and in this list the name of Kåñëa also appears. But then it is said\\nthat this Kåñëa is not an incarnatio n of God but is the original Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead Himself ( ete cäàça-kaläù puàsaù kåñëas tu bhagavä n\\nsvayam ).\\nSimilarly, in Bhagavad-gétä  the Lord says, mattaù parataraà nänyat : “There\\nis nothing superior to My form as th e Personality of Godhead Kåñëa.” He also\\nsays elsewhere in Bhagavad-gétä,  aham ädir hi devänäm : “I am the origin of all\\nthe demigods.” And after understanding Bhagavad-gétä  from Kåñëa, Arjuna\\nalso confirms this in the following words: paraà brahma paraà dhäma\\npavitram-paramaà bhavän , “I now fully understand that You are the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the re fuge of\\neverything.” Therefore the universal fo rm which Kåñëa showed to Arjuna is\\nnot the original form of God. The orig inal is the Kåñëa form. The universal\\nform, with its thousands and thousands of  heads and hands, is manifest just to\\ndraw the attention of those who have no love for God. It is not God’s original\\nform.\\nThe universal form is not attractive fo r pure devotees, who are in love with\\nthe Lord in different transcendental  relationships. The Supreme Godhead\\nexchanges transcendental love in His original form of Kåñëa. Therefore to\\nArjuna, who was so intimately rel ated with Kåñëa in friendship, this form of\\nthe universal manifestation was not plea sing; rather, it was fearful. Arjuna,\\nwho was a constant companion of Kåñëa’s, must have had transcendental eyes;\\nhe was not an ordinary man. Therefore he was not captivate d by the universal\\nform. This form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating\\nthemselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional\\nservice the two-handed form of Kåñëa is the most dear.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Therefore , this verse is considered to be the\\nessence of Bhagavad-gétä.  The Bhagavad-gétä  is a book directed to the\\nconditioned souls, who are engaged in the material world with the purpose ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.lording it over nature and who do no t know of the real, spiritual life. The\\nBhagavad-gétä  is meant to show how one can understand his spiritual existence\\nand his eternal relationship with th e supreme spiritual personality and to\\nteach one how to go back home, back to  Godhead. Now here is the verse which\\nclearly explains the pr ocess by which one can attain success in his spiritual\\nactivity: devotional service.\\nA s  f a r  a s  w o r k  i s  c o n c e r n e d ,  o n e  s h ould transfer his energy entirely to\\nKåñëa conscious activities. As stated in the Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  (2.255 ),\\nanäsaktasya viñayän\\nyathärham upayuïjataù\\nnirbandhaù kåñëa-sambandhe\\nyuktaà vairägyam ucyate\\nNo work should be done by any man exce pt in relationship to Kåñëa. This is\\ncalled kåñëa-karma.  One may be engaged in various activities, but one should\\nnot be attached to the result of his wo rk; the result should be done only for\\nHim. For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that\\nactivity into Kåñëa consciousness, one ha s to do business for Kåñëa. If Kåñëa is\\nthe proprietor of the business, then Kåñëa should enjoy the profit of the\\nbusiness. If a businessman is in possession of thousand s and thousands of\\ndollars, and if he has to offer all this to  Kåñëa, he can do it. This is work for\\nKåñëa. Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification, he can\\nconstruct a nice temple for Kåñëa, and he can install the Deity of Kåñëa and\\narrange for the Deity’s service, as is  outlined in the authorized books of\\ndevotional service. This is all kåñëa-karma.  One should not be attached to the\\nresult of his work, but the result shou ld be offered to Kåñëa, and one should\\naccept as prasädam  the remnants of offerings to Kå ñëa. If one constructs a very\\nbig building for Kåñëa and installs the Deity of Kåñëa, one is not prohibited\\nf r o m  l i v i n g  t h e r e ,  b u t  i t  i s  u n d e r s t o o d  that the proprietor of the building is\\nKåñëa. That is called Kåñëa consciousne ss. If, however, one is not able to\\nconstruct a temple for Kåñëa, one can engage himself in cleansing the temple\\nof Kåñëa; that is also kåñëa-karma.  One can cultivate a garden. Anyone who\\nhas land—in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of la nd—canCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.utilize that for Kåñëa by growing flowers to offer Him. One can sow tulasé\\nplants, because tulasé  leaves are very important and Kåñëa has recommended\\nthis in Bhagavad-gétä.  Patraà puñpaà phalaà toyam . Kåñëa desires that one\\noffer Him either a leaf, or a flower, or fruit, or a little water—and by such an\\noffering He is satisfied. This leaf especially refers to the tulasé.  So one can sow\\ntulasé  and pour water on the plant. Thus , even the poorest man can engage in\\nthe service of Kåñëa. These are some of  the examples of how one can engage in\\nworking for Kåñëa.\\nThe word mat-paramaù  refers to one who considers the association of Kåñëa\\nin His supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life. Such a person does\\nnot wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or\\nheavenly planets, or even the h ighest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He\\nhas no attraction for that. He is only  attracted to being transferred to the\\nspiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into\\nthe glowing brahmajyoti  effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual\\nplanet, namely Kåñëaloka, Goloka Våndävana. He has full knowledge of that\\nplanet, and therefore he is not interest ed in any other. As indicated by the\\nword mad-bhaktaù,  he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the\\nnine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering,\\nworshiping, serving the lotus feet of th e Lord, offering prayers, carrying out\\nthe orders of the Lord, making friend s with Him, and surrendering everything\\nto Him. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or\\nat least in one, and that will surely make one perfect.\\nThe term saìga-varjitaù  is very significant. One should disassociate himself\\nfrom persons who are against Kåñëa. Not only are the atheistic persons against\\nKåñëa, but so also are those who are attr acted to fruitive activities and mental\\nspeculation. Theref ore the pure form of devotional service is described in\\nBhakti-rasämåta-sindhu  (1.1.11 ) as follows:\\nanyäbhiläñitä-çünyaà\\njïäna-karmädy-anävåtam\\nänukülyena kåñëänu-\\nçélanaà bhaktir uttamä\\n [Madhya 19.167 ]Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.In this verse Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé clea rly states that if anyone wants to\\nexecute unalloyed devotional service, he must be freed from all kinds of\\nmaterial contamination. He must be fr eed from the association of persons who\\nare addicted to fruitive activitie s and mental speculation. When, freed from\\nsuch unwanted association and from th e contamination of material desires,\\none favorably cultivates knowledge of Kåñëa, that is called pure devotional\\nservice. Änukülyasya saìkalpaù prätikülyasya varjanam  (Hari-bha kti-viläsa\\n11.676 ). One should think of Kåñëa and act for Kåñëa favorably, not\\nunfavorably. Kaàsa was an enemy of Kåñëa’s. From the very beginning of\\nKåñëa’s birth, Kaàsa planned in so many  ways to kill Him, and because he was\\nalways unsuccessful, he was a lways thinking of Kåñëa. Thus while working,\\nwhile eating and while sleeping, he was always Kåñëa conscious in every\\nrespect, but that Kåñëa consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite\\nof his always thinking of Kåñëa twenty-four hours a day, he  was considered a\\ndemon, and Kåñëa at last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by Kåñëa\\nattains salvation immediately, but that is  not the aim of the pure devotee. The\\npure devotee does not even want salvatio n. He does not want to be transferred\\neven to the highest planet, Goloka Våndäv ana. His only objective is to serve\\nKåñëa wherever he may be.\\nA devotee of Kåñëa is friendly to everyo ne. Therefore it is said here that he\\nhas no enemy ( nirvairaù ). How is this? A devotee situated in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness knows that only devotional  service to Kåñëa can relieve a person\\nfrom all the problems of life. H e has personal experience of this, and therefore\\nhe wants to introduce this system, Kå ñëa consciousness, into human society.\\nThere are many examples in history of devotees of the Lord who risked their\\nlives for the spreading of God consciousness. The favor ite example is Lord\\nJesus Christ. He was crucified by the nond evotees, but he sacrificed his life for\\nspreading God consciousness. Of course, it would be superficial to understand\\nthat he was killed. Similarly, in India also there are many examples, such a s\\nÖhäkura Haridäsa and Prahläda Mahäräja. Why such risk? Because they\\nwanted to spread Kåñëa consciousness, and it is difficult. A Kåñëa conscious\\nperson knows that if a man is suffering it is due to his forgetfulness of his\\neternal relationship with Kåñëa . Therefore, the highest benefit one can renderCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.to human society is relieving one’s neighbor from all material problems. In\\nsuch a way, a pure devotee is engaged in  the service of the Lord. Now, we can\\nimagine how merciful Kåñëa is  to those engaged in His service, risking\\neverything for Him. Therefore it is certain that such persons must reach the\\nsupreme planet after leaving the body.\\nIn summary, the universal form of Kåñëa, which is a temporary\\nmanifestation, and the form of time which devours everything, and even the\\nform of Viñëu, four-handed, have all been exhibited by Kåñëa. Thus Kåñëa is\\nthe origin of all these manifestations. It is not that Kåñëa is a manifestation of\\nthe original viçva-rüpa,  or Viñëu. Kåñëa is the origin of all forms. There are\\nhundreds and thousands of Viñëus, bu t for a devotee no form of Kåñëa is\\nimportant but the original form, two-handed Çyämasundara. In the\\nBrahma-saàhitä  it is stated that those who are attached to the Çyämasundara\\nform of Kåñëa in love and devotion can see Him always within the heart and\\ncannot see anything else. One should understand, therefore, that the purport\\nof this Eleventh Chapter is that the form of Kåñëa is essential and supreme.\\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eleventh Chapter of the Çrémad\\nBhagavad-gétä  in the matter of the Universal Form.\\n- CHAPTER 12 -\\nDevotional Service\\nTEXT  1\\nAJauRNa ovac )\\nWv& SaTaTaYau¢-a Yae >a¢-aSTva& PaYauRPaaSaTae )Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Generally, the\\ntranscendentalists can be divided into two classes. One is the impersonalist,\\nand the other is the personalist. T he personalist devotee engages himself with\\nall energy in the service of the Suprem e Lord. The impersonalist also engages\\nhimself, not directly in the service of Kåñëa but in meditation on the\\nimpersonal Brahman, the unmanifested.\\nWe find in this chapter that of the di fferent processes for realization of the\\nAbsolute Truth, bhakti-yoga,  devotional service, is the highest. If one at all\\ndesires to have the association of th e Supreme Personality of Godhead, thenCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.he must take to devoti onal service.\\nThose who worship the Supreme Lord di rectly by devotional service are\\ncalled personalists. Those who engage themselves in meditation on the\\nimpersonal Brahman are called impersonalists. Arjuna is here questioning\\nwhich position is better. There are differe nt ways to realize the Absolute\\nTruth, but Kåñëa indicates in this chapter that bhakti-yoga,  or devotional\\nservice to Him, is the highest of all. It is the most direct, and it is the easiest\\nmeans for association with the Godhead.\\nIn the Second Chapter  of Bhagavad-gétä,  the Supreme Lord explained that\\na living entity is not the material body; he is a spiritual spark. And the\\nAbsolute Truth is the spiritual whole. In the Seventh Chapter  He spoke of the\\nliving entity as being part and  parcel of the supreme whole and recommended\\nthat he transfer his attention fully  to the whole. Then again in the Eighth\\nChapter  it was said that anyone who thinks of Kåñëa at the time of quitting his\\nbody is at once transferred to the spiritual sky, to th e abode of Kåñëa. And at\\nthe end of the Sixth Chapter  the Lord clearly said that of all yogés,  one who\\nalways thinks of Kåñëa within himself is considered the most perfect. So in\\npractically every chapter the conclusion has been that one should be attached\\nto the personal form of Kåñëa, for that is the highest spiritual realization.\\nNevertheless, there are those who are no t attached to the personal form of\\nKåñëa. They are so firmly detached  that even in the preparation of\\ncommentaries to Bhagavad-gétä  they want to distract other people from Kåñëa\\nand transfer all devotion to the imper sonal brahmajyoti.  They prefer to\\nmeditate on the impersonal form of th e Absolute Truth, which is beyond the\\nreach of the senses and is not manifest.\\nAnd so, factually, there are two classes of transcendentalists. Now Arjuna is\\ntrying to settle the question of which pr ocess is easier and which of the classes\\nis most perfect. In other words, he is clarifying his own position because he is\\nattached to the  personal form of Kåñëa. He is  not attached to the impersonal\\nBrahman. He wants to know whether hi s position is secure. The impersonal\\nmanifestation, either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the\\nSupreme Lord, is a problem for meditation.

To make progress in that\\ndiscipline is always difficult for those who are embodied.\\nPURPORT\\nThe group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable,\\nunmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord are called jïäna-yogés,\\nand persons who are in full Kåñëa consciou sness, engaged in devotional service\\nto the Lord, are called bhakti-yogés.  Now, here the difference between\\njïäna-yoga  and bhakti-yoga  is definitely expressed. The process of jïäna-yoga,\\nalthough ultimately bringing one to the same goal, is very troublesome,\\nwhereas the path of bhakti-yoga,  the process of being in dir ect service to theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Supreme Personality of Godhead, is ea sier and is natural for the embodied\\nsoul. The individual soul is embodied since time immemorial. It is very difficult\\nfor him to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body. Therefore,\\nthe bhakti-yogé  accepts the Deity of Kåñëa as worshipable because there is some\\nbodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. Of course,\\nworship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple\\nis not idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may\\nbe saguëa  and nirguëa —of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes.\\nWorship of the Deity in the temple is saguëa  worship, for the Lord is\\nrepresented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented\\nby material qualities such as stone, wood  or oil paint, is not actually material.\\nThat is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord.\\nA crude example may be given here. We  may find some mailboxes on the\\nstreet, and if we post our letters in thos e boxes, they will naturally go to their\\ndestination without difficulty. But any ol d box, or an imitation which we may\\nfind somewhere but which i s not authorized by the post office, will not do the\\nwork. Similarly, God has an authorized representation in the Deity form,\\nwhich is called arcä-vigraha . This arcä-vigraha  is an incarnation of the\\nSupreme Lord. God will accept service through that form. The Lord is\\nomnipotent, all-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation  as arcä-vigraha  He can\\naccept the services of the devotee, just  to make it convenient for the man in\\nconditioned life.\\nSo for a devotee there is no diffi culty in approaching the Supreme\\nimmediately and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way\\nto spiritual realization the path is di fficult. They have to understand the\\nunmanifested representation of the S upreme through such Vedic literatures as\\nthe Upaniñads,  and they have to learn the language, understand the\\nnonperceptual feelings, and realize all these processes. This is not very easy for\\na common man. A person in Kåñëa consciousness, engaged in devotio nal\\nservice, simply by the guidance of th e bona fide spiritual master, simply by\\noffering regulative obeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of\\nthe Lord, and simply by eating the remnan ts of foodstuffs offered to the Lord,\\nrealizes the Sup reme Personality of Godhead very easily. There is no doubtCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.that the impersonalists are unnecessarily  taking a troublesome path with the\\nrisk of not realizing the Absolute Truth at the ultimate end. But the\\npersonalist, without any risk, trouble or difficul ty, approaches the Supreme\\nPersonality directly. A similar passage appears in Çrémad-Bhägavatam.  It is\\nstated there that if one ultimately has to surrender unto the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead (this surrendering process is called bhakti ), but instead\\ntakes the trouble to understand what is Brahman and what is not Brahman\\nand spends his whole life in that way, the result is simply troublesome.\\nTherefore it is advised here that one sh ould not take up this troublesome path\\nof self-realization, because there  is uncertainty in the ultimate result.\\nA living entity is eternally an individu al soul, and if he wants to merge into\\nthe spiritual whole, he may accomplish  the realization of the eternal and\\nknowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion is not\\nrealized. By the grace of  some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly learned\\nin the process of jïäna-yoga,  may come to the point of bhakti-yoga,  or\\ndevotional service. At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes a\\nsource of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. Therefore an embodied\\nsoul is always in difficulty with the un manifest, both at the time of practice\\nand at the time of realization. Every living soul is partially independent, and\\none should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is aga inst the\\nnature of his spiritual blissful self. On e should not take up this process. For\\nevery individual living entity the proce ss of Kåñëa consciousness, which entails\\nfull engagement in devotional service, is  the best way. If one wants to ignore\\nthis de votional service, there is the danger  of turning to atheism. Thus the\\nprocess of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which\\nis beyond the approach of the senses, as  already expressed in this verse, should\\nnever be encouraged at any t ime, especially in this age. It is not advised by\\nLord Kåñëa.\\nTEXTS  6–7\\nYae Tau SavaRi<a k-MaaRi<a MaiYa SaNNYaSYa MaTPara\" )\\nANaNYaeNaEv YaaeGaeNa Maa& DYaaYaNTa oPaaSaTae )) 6 ))Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The devotee does not\\ndesire any achievement other than pleasing the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead. His life’s mission is to please Kåñëa, and he can sa crifice everything\\nfor Kåñëa’s satisfaction, just as Arjuna  did in the Battle of Kurukñetra. The\\nprocess is very simple: one can devote himself in his occupation and engage at\\nthe same time in chanting Hare Kåñëa,  Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/\\nHare R äma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare.

A child is completely cared for by his\\nparents, and thus his position is secure . Similarly, a devotee does not need toCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

But if someone comes and picks\\nhim up from the water, then he is easily rescued. Similarly, the Lord picks up\\nthe devotee from this material existence. One simply has to practice the easy\\nprocess of Kåñëa consciousness and fully engage himself in devotional service.\\nAny intelligent man should always pr efer the process of devotional service to\\nall other paths.

For this second cl ass there are different prescribed rules\\nand regulations one can follow to be ultimately elevated to the stage of\\nattachment to Kåñëa.\\nBhakti-yoga  is the purification of the senses. At the present moment in\\nmaterial existence the senses are always impure, being engaged in sense\\ngratification. But by the practice of bhakti-yoga  these senses can become\\npurified, and in the purified state th ey come directly in contact with the\\nSupreme Lord. In this material existenc e, I may be engaged in some service to\\nsome master, but I don’t really lovingly serve my master. I simply serve to get\\nsome money. And the master also is not in love; he takes serv ice from me and\\npays me. So there is no question of love. But for spiritual life, one must be\\nelevated to the pure stage of love. Th at stage of love can be achieved by\\npractice of devotional service, performed with the present senses.\\nThis love of God is now in a dormant state in everyone’s heart. And, there,\\nlove of God is manifested in different ways, but it is contaminated by material\\nassociation.

There are various rules and\\nregulations which one should follow. And one should constantly hear\\nBhagavad-gétä  and Çrémad-Bhägavatam  from pure devotees.

The same work, however, can be\\nperformed for the satisfaction of Kåñëa, and that is spiritual activity. If one has\\nsufficient money, h e can help in building an office or temple for propagating\\nKåñëa consciousness. Or he can help with publications. There are various\\nfields of activity, and one should be inte rested in such activities. If one cannot\\nsacrifice the results of his activities, the same person can still sacrifice some\\npercentage to propagate Kåñëa consciousness.

If one attach es himself directly to the activities of\\nKåñëa consciousne ss, there may be objections from family members, or so many\\nother difficulties. For one who has such  a problem, it is advised that he\\nsacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause. Such\\nprocedures are described in the Vedic rules. T here are many descriptions of\\nsacrifices and special functions of puëya,  or special work in which the result of\\none’s previous action may be applied.

It is also found that when one who is no t even\\ninterested in the activities of Kåñë a consciousness gives charity to some\\nhospital or some other social institutio n, he gives up the hard-earned results of\\nhis activities. That is also recommended here because by the practice of giving\\nup the fruits  of one’s activities one is sure to purify his mind gradually, and in\\nthat purified stage of mind one becomes able to understand Kåñëa\\nconsciousness. Of course Kåñëa consci ousness is not dependent on any other\\nexperience, because Kåñëa consciousness itself  can purify one’s mind, but if\\nthere are impediments to accepting Kåñë a consciousness, one may try to give\\nup the results of his actions.

By meditation\\none can be able to understand the Supreme Personality o f Godhead by a\\ngradual process. There are processes which make one understand that one\\nhimself is the Supreme, and that sort of meditation is preferred if one is unable\\nto engage in devotional service. If one is not able to meditate in such a way,\\nthen the re are prescribed duties, as enjoined in the Vedic literature, for the\\nbrähmaëas, kñatriyas, vaiçyas  and çüdras,  which we shall find in the last chapter\\nof Bhagavad-gétä.

All Rights Reserved.In summary, to reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the highest\\ngoal, there are two processes: one process is by gradual development, and the\\nother process is direct. Devotional serv ice in Kåñëa consciousness is the direct\\nmethod, and the other method  involves renouncing the fruits of one’s\\nactivities. Then one can come to the stage of knowledge, then to the stage of\\nmeditation, then to the stage of unders tanding the Supersoul, and then to the\\nstage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One may take e ither the\\nstep-by-step process or the direct path. The direct process is not possible for\\neveryone; therefore the indirect process is also good. It is, however, to be\\nunderstood that the indirect process is not recommended for Arjuna, because\\nhe is already  at the stage of loving devotional  service to the Supreme Lord. It is\\nfor others, who are not at this stage; for them the gradual process of\\nrenunciation, knowledge, meditation and realization of the Supersoul and\\nBrahman should be followed. But as far as Bhagavad-gétä  is concerned, it is the\\ndirect method that is stressed. Everyone is advised to take to the direct method\\nand surrender  unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa.\\nTEXTS  13–14\\nAÜeía SavR>aUTaaNaa& MaE}a\" k-å<a Wv c )\\niNaMaRMaae iNarhªar\" SaMadu\"%Sau%\" +aMaq )) 13 ))\\nSaNTauí\" SaTaTa& YaaeGaq YaTaaTMaa d*!iNaêYa\" )\\nMaYYaiPaRTaMaNaaebuiÖYaaeR MaÙ¢-\" Sa Mae iPa[Ya\" )) 14 ))\\nadveñöä sarva-bhütänäà\\nmaitraù karuëa eva ca\\nnirmamo nirahaìkäraù\\nsama-duùkha-sukhaù kñamé\\nsantuñöaù satataà yogé\\nyatätmä dåòha-niçcayaù\\nmayy arpita-mano-buddhirCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

A pure\\ndevotee is never disturbed in any circumstances. Nor is he envious of anyone.\\nNor does a devotee be come his enemy’s enemy; he thinks, “This person is\\nacting as my enemy due to my own past misdeeds. So it is better to suffer than\\nto protest.” In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (10.14.8 ) it is stated: tat te ’nukampäà\\nsusamékñamäëo bhuïjäna evätma-kåtaà vipäkam.  Wh enever a devotee is in\\ndistress or has fallen into difficulty, he thinks that it is the Lord’s mercy upon\\nh i m .  H e  t h i n k s ,  “ T h a n k s  t o  m y  p a s t  misdeeds I should suffer far, far greater\\nthan I am suffering now.

All Rights Reserved.of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. ” Therefore he is always calm, quiet\\nand patient, despite many distressful co nditions. A devotee is also always kind\\nto everyone, ev en to his enemy. Nirmama  means that a devotee does not\\nattach much importance to the pain s and trouble pertaining to the body\\nbecause he knows perfectly well that he is not the material body. He does not\\nidentify with the body; therefore he is freed from t he conception of false ego\\nand is equipoised in happiness and distress.  He is tolerant, and he is satisfied\\nwith whatever comes by the grace of the Supreme Lord. He does not endeavor\\nmuch to achieve something with great difficulty; therefore he is always j oyful.\\nHe is a completely perfect mystic be cause he is fixed in the instructions\\nreceived from the spiritual master, and because his senses are controlled he is\\ndetermined. He is not swayed by false arguments, because no one can lead him\\nfrom the fixed det ermination of devotional service. He is fully conscious that\\nKåñëa is the eternal Lord, so no one ca n disturb him. All these qualifications\\nenable him to fix his mind and intelli gence entirely on the Supreme Lord.\\nSuch a standard of devotional service is u ndoubtedly very rare, but a devotee\\nbecomes situated in that stage by following the regulative principles of\\ndevotional service. Furthermore, the Lord  says that such a devotee is very dear\\nto Him, for the Lord is always pleased with all his activities in f ull Kåñëa\\nconsciousness.\\nTEXT  15\\nYaSMaaàaeiÜJaTae l/aek-ae l/aek-aàaeiÜJaTae c Ya\" )\\nhzaRMazR>aYaaeÜeGaEMauR¢-ae Ya\" Sa c Mae iPa[Ya\" )) 15 ))\\nyasmän nodvijate loko\\nlokän nodvijate ca yaù\\nharñämarña-bhayodvegair\\nmukto yaù sa ca me priyaù\\nSYNONYMSCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Naturally a devotee takes a bath at least twice in a day and rises early\\nin the morning for devotional service. Thus he is naturally clean both inwardly\\nand outwardly. A devotee is always expert because he fully knows the essence\\nof all activities of life and he is convinced of the authoritative scriptures. A\\ndevotee never takes the part of a par ticular party; therefore he is carefree. He\\nis never pained, because he is free from all designations; he knows that his\\nbody is a designation, so if there are some bodily pains, he is free. The pure\\ndevotee does not endeavor for anything which is against the principles of\\ndevotional service.

Silent does not mean that one should\\nnot speak; silent means that one should  not speak nonsense. One should speak\\nonly of essentials, and the most essential speech for  the devotee is to speak for\\nthe sake of the Supreme Lord. A devotee is happy in all conditions; sometimes\\nhe may get very palatable foodstuffs, sometimes not, but he is satisfied. Nor\\ndoes he care for any residential facility. He may sometimes live undern eath a\\ntree, and he may sometimes live in a very  palatial building; he is attracted to\\nneither.

Such processes are\\nvery dear to the Lord, and He accepts a person engaged in them. The question\\nof who is better—one who is engaged in  the path of impersonal Brahman or\\none who is engaged in the personal service of the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhea d—was raised by Arjuna, and the Lord replied to him so explicitly that\\nthere is no doubt that devotional servic e to the Personality of Godhead is the\\nbest of all processes of spiritual realizatio n. In other words, in this chapter it is\\ndecided that through  good association one develops attachment for pure\\ndevotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual master and from\\nhim begins to hear and chant and ob serve the regulative principles ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.devotional service with faith, attachment and devotion and  thus becomes\\nengaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This path is recommended\\nin this chapter; therefore there is no do ubt that devotional service is the only\\nabsolute path for self-realization, for the attainment of the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the Supreme Absolute\\nTruth, as described in this chapter, is  recommended only up to the time one\\nsurrenders himself for self-realization. In other words, as long as one does not\\nhave the chance to associate with a pure  devotee, the impersonal conception\\nmay be beneficial. In the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth one\\nworks without fruitive result, meditates and cultivates knowledge to\\nunderstand spirit and matter. This is necessary as long as one is not in the\\nassociation of a pure devotee. Fortunatel y, if one develops directly a desire to\\nengage in Kåñëa consciousness in pure de votional service, he does not need to\\nundergo step-by-step improvements in sp iritual realization. Devotional service,\\nas described in t he middle six chapters of Bhagavad-gétä,  is more congenial.\\nOne need not bother about materials to keep body and soul together, because\\nby the grace of the Lord everything is carried out automatically.\\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Twelfth Chapter of the Çrémad\\nBhagavad-gétä  in the matter of Devotional Service.\\n- CHAPTER 13 -\\nNature, the Enjoyer, and Consciousness\\nTEXTS  1–2\\nAJauRNa ovacCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

All Rights Reserved.The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: This body, O son of Kunté, is calle d\\nthe field, and one who knows this body is called the knower of the field.\\nPURPORT\\nArjuna was inquisitive about prakåti  (nature), puruña  (the enjoyer), kñetra\\n(the field), kñetra-jïa  (its knower), and knowledge and the object of\\nknowledge. When he inquired about all these, Kåñëa said that this body is\\ncalled the field and that one who kn ows this body is called the knower of the\\nfield. This body is the field of ac tivity for the conditioned soul. The\\nconditioned soul is entrapped in material  existence, and he attempts to lord it\\nover material nature. And so, according to his capacity to dom inate material\\nnature, he gets a field of activity. That field of activity is the body. And what is\\nthe body? The body is made of senses . The conditioned soul wants to enjoy\\nsense gratification, and, according to hi s capacity to enjoy sense gratification,\\nhe is offered a body, or field of activity. Therefore the body is called kñetra,  or\\nthe field of activity for the conditione d soul. Now, the person, who should not\\nidentify himself with the body, is called kñetra-jïa,  the knower of the field. It is\\nnot ver y difficult to understand the difference between the field and its\\nknower, the body and the knower of th e body. Any person can consider that\\nfrom childhood to old age he undergoes so many changes of body and yet is\\nstill one person, remaining. Thus there i s a difference between the knower of\\nthe field of activities and the actual fi eld of activities. A living conditioned\\nsoul can thus understand that he is different from the body. It is described in\\nthe beginning— dehino ’smin —that the living entity is withi n the body and\\nthat the body is changing from chil dhood to boyhood and from boyhood to\\nyouth and from youth to old age, and the person who owns the body knows\\nthat the body is changing. The owner is distinctly kñetra-jïa.  Sometimes we\\nthink, “I am happy,” “I am a man,” “I am a woman,” “I am a dog,” “I am a cat.”\\nThese are the bodily designations of the knower. But the knower is different\\nfrom the body. Although we may use many articles—our clothes, etc.—we\\nknow that we are different from the things used. Si milarly, we also understand\\nby a little contemplation that we are different from the body. I or you orCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.anyone else who owns the body is called kñetra-jïa,  the knower of the field of\\nactivities, and the body is called kñetra,  the field of activities itself.\\nIn the first six chapters of Bhagavad-gétä  the knower of the body (the living\\nentity) and the position by which he can understand the Supreme Lord are\\ndescribed. In the middle six chapters of the Bhagavad-gétä  the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead and the rel ationship between the individual soul and\\nthe Supersoul in regard to devotional  service are described. The superior\\nposition of the Supreme Personality of  Godhead and the subordinate position\\nof the individual soul are definitely defined in these chapters.  The living\\nentities are subordinate under all circum stances, but in their forgetfulness they\\nare suffering. When enlightened by pi ous activities, they approach the\\nSupreme Lord in different capacities —as the distressed, those in want of\\nmoney, the inquisi tive, and those in search of knowledge. That is also\\ndescribed. Now, starting with the Th irteenth Chapter, how the living entity\\ncomes into contact with material nature and how he is delivered by the\\nSupreme Lord through the different methods of fruitive a ctivities, cultivation\\nof knowledge, and the discharge of de votional service are explained. Although\\nthe living entity is completely differe nt from the material body, he somehow\\nbecomes related. This also is explained.\\nTEXT  3\\n+ae}aj& caiPa Maa& iviÖ SavR+ae}aezu >aarTa )\\n+ae}a+ae}ajYaaejaRNa& YataJjaNa& MaTa& MaMa )) 3 ))\\nkñetra-jïaà cäpi mäà viddhi\\nsarva-kñetreñu bhärata\\nkñetra-kñetrajïayor jïänaà\\nyat taj jïänaà mataà mama\\nSYNONYMS\\nkñetra-jïam —the knower of the field; ca—also; api—certainly; mäm —Me;Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

That is\\nMy opinion.\\nPURPORT\\nWhile discussing the subject of the bo dy and the knower of the body, the\\nsoul and the Supersoul, we shall find th ree different topics of study: the Lord,\\nthe living entity, and matter. In every field of activities, in every body, there\\nare two souls: the i ndividual soul and the Supersoul. Because the Supersoul is\\nthe plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, Kåñëa\\nsays, “I am also the knower, but I am no t the individual knower of the body. I\\nam the superknower. I am present in every bo dy as the Paramätmä, or\\nSupersoul.”\\nOne who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the knower\\nof the field very minutely, in terms of this Bhagavad-gétä,  can attain to\\nknowledge.\\nThe Lord says, “I am the knower of the field of activities in every individual\\nbody.” The individual may be the know er of his own body, but he is not in\\nknowledge of other bodies. The Supr eme Personality of Godhead, who is\\npresent as the Supersoul in all b odies, knows everything about all bodies. He\\nknows all the different bodies of all th e various species of life. A citizen may\\nknow everything about his patch of la nd, but the king knows not only his\\npalace but all the properties possessed by the individual  citizens. Similarly, one\\nmay be the proprietor of the body indi vidually, but the Supreme Lord is the\\nproprietor of all bodies. The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom, and\\nthe citizen is the secondary propriet or. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.supreme proprietor of all bodies.\\nThe body consists of the senses. The Supreme Lord is Håñékeça, Which\\nmeans “the controller of the senses.” He is the original controller of the senses,\\njust as the king is the original controlle r of all the activities of the state; the\\ncitizens are seconda ry controllers. The Lord says, “I am also the knower.” This\\nmeans that He is the superknower; th e individual soul knows only his\\nparticular body. In the Vedic literature, it is stated as follows:\\nkñeträëi hi çaréräëi\\nbéjaà cäpi çubhäçubhe\\ntäni vetti sa yogätmä\\ntataù kñetra-jïa ucyate\\nThis body is called the kñetra,  and within it dwells the owner of the body\\nand the Supreme Lord, who knows both the body and the owner of the body.\\nTherefore He is called the knower of all fields. The distinction between the\\nfield of activities, the knower  of activities, and the supreme knower of\\nactivities is described as follows. Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the\\nbody, the constitution of the individual soul, and the constitution of the\\nSupersoul is known in terms of Vedic literature as jïäna.  That is the opinion of\\nKåñëa. To understand both the soul an d the Supersoul as one yet distinct is\\nknowledge. One who does not understand the field of activity and the knower\\nof activity is not in perfect knowledge.  One has to understand the position of\\nprakåti  (nature), puruña  (the enjoyer of nature) and éçvara  ( t h e  k n o w e r  w h o\\ndominates or controls nature and the in dividual soul). One should not confuse\\nthe three in their different capacities. One should not confuse the painter, the\\npainting and the easel.  This material world, which is the field of activities, is\\nnature, and the enjoyer of nature is th e living entity, and above them both is\\nthe supreme controller, the Personality of  Godhead. It is stated in the Vedic\\nlanguage (in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  1.12), bhoktä bhogyaà preritäraà ca\\nmatvä/ sarvaà proktaà tri vidham-brahmam etat.  There are three Brahman\\nconceptions: prakåti  is Brahman as the field of activities, and the jéva\\n(individual soul) is also Brahman and is trying to control material nature, a nd\\nthe controller of both of them is also Brahman, but He is the factual controller.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.In this chapter it will also be explain ed that out of the two knowers, one is\\nfallible and the other is infallible. One is  superior and the other is subordinate.\\nOne who understands the two knowers of the field to be one and the same\\ncontradicts the Suprem e Personality of Godhead, who states here very clearly,\\n“I am also the knower of the field of activity.” One who misunderstands a rope\\nto be a serpent is not in knowledge. There are different kinds of bodies, and\\nthere are different owners of the bodies. B ecause each individual soul has his\\nindividual capacity for lording it ov er material nature, there are different\\nbodies. But the Supreme also is presen t in them as the controller. The word ca\\nis significant, for it indicates the total number of bodies. Tha t is the opinion of\\nÇréla Baladeva Vidyäbhüñaëa. Kåñëa is th e Supersoul present in each and every\\nbody apart from the individual soul. An d Kåñëa explicitly says here that the\\nSupersoul is the controller of both the field of activities and the finite enjoye r.\\nTEXT  4\\nTaT+ae}a& YaÀ Yaad*Kc YaiÜk-air YaTaê YaTa( )\\nSa c Yaae YaTPa[>aavê TaTSaMaaSaeNa Mae é*<au )) 4 ))\\ntat kñetraà yac ca yädåk ca\\nyad-vikäri yataç ca yat\\nsa ca yo yat-prabhävaç ca\\ntat samäsena me çåëu\\nSYNONYMS\\ntat—that; kñetram —field of activities; yat—what; ca—also; yädåk —as it is;\\nca—also; yat—having what; vikäri —changes; yataù —from which; ca—also;\\nyat—what; saù—he; ca—also; yaù—who; yat—having what;\\nprabhävaù —influence; ca—also; tat—that; samäsena —in summary;  me—from\\nMe; çåëu—understand.\\nTRANSLATIONCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

It is especially presented in\\nVedänta-sütra with all reasoning as to cause and effect.\\nPURPORT\\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is the highest authority in\\nexplaining this knowledge. Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and\\nstandard authorities always give eviden ce from previous authorities. Kåñëa is\\nexplaining this most controve rsial point regarding the duality and nonduality\\nof the soul and the Supersoul by referring to a scripture, the Vedänta,  which is\\naccepted as authority. First He says, “T his is according to different sages.” As\\nfar as the sages are concerned, besides Himse lf, Vyäsadeva (the author of the\\nVedänta-sütra ) is a great sage, and in the Vedänta-sütra  duality is perfectly\\nexplained. And Vyäsadeva’s father, Paräçara , is also a great sage, and he writes\\nin his books of religiosity, aham tvaà ca tathänye.  .. “we—you, I and the various\\nother living entities—are all transcende ntal, although in material bodies. Now\\nwe are fallen into the ways of the thr ee modes of material nature according to\\nour different karma.  As such, some are on higher levels, and some are in the\\nlower nature. The higher and lower natu res exist due to ignorance and are\\nbeing manifested in an infinite number of living entities. But the Supersoul,\\nwhich is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is\\ntranscendental.” Similarly, in the original Vedas,  a distinction between the\\nsoul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the Kaöha Upaniñad.\\nThere are many great sages who have explained this, and Paräçara is\\nconsidered principal among them.\\nThe word chandobhiù  refers to the various Vedic literatures. The Taittiréya\\nUpaniñad,  for example, which is a branch of the Yajur Veda,  describes nature,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\\nAs stated before, kñetra  is the field of activities, and there are two kinds of\\nkñetra-jïa:  the individual living entity and the supreme living entity. As stated\\nin the Taittiréya Upaniñad  (2.9), brahma pucchaà pratiñöhä.  There is a\\nmanifestation of the Su preme Lord’s energy known as anna-maya,  dependence\\nupon food for existence. This is a ma terialistic realization of the Supreme.\\nThen, in präëa-maya,  after realizing the Supreme Absolute Truth in food, one\\ncan realize the Absolute Truth in the living sympto ms or life forms. In\\njïäna-maya,  realization extends beyond the living symptoms to the point of\\nthinking, feeling and willing. Then th ere is Brahman realization, called\\nvijïäna-maya,  in which the living entity’s mind and life symptoms are\\ndistinguished fro m the living entity himself. The next and supreme stage is\\nänanda-maya,  realization of the all-blissful na ture. Thus there are five stages of\\nBrahman realization, which are called brahma puccham.  Out of these, the first\\nthree— anna-maya, präëa-maya  and jïäna-maya —involve the fields of\\nactivities of the living entities. Transcende ntal to all these fields of activities is\\nthe Supreme Lord, who is called änanda-maya.  The Vedänta-sütra  also\\ndescribes the Supreme by saying, änanda-mayo ’bhyäsät:  the Supreme\\nPerso nality of Godhead is by nature full of joy. To enjoy His transcendental\\nbliss, He expands into vijïäna-maya, präëa-maya, jïäna-maya  and anna-maya.\\nIn the field of activities the living enti ty is considered to be the enjoyer, and\\ndifferent from him is the änanda-maya.  That means that if the living entity\\ndecides to enjoy in dovetailing himself with the änanda-maya,  then he\\nbecomes perfect. This is the real pict ure of the Supreme Lord as the supreme\\nknower of the field, the living entity as the subordinate kn ower, and the\\nnature of the field of activities. One has to search for this truth in the\\nVedänta-sütra,  or Brahma-sütra.\\nIt is mentioned here that the codes of the Brahma-sütra  are very nicely\\narranged according to cause and effect. Some of the sütras,  or aphorisms, are\\nna viyad açruteù  (2.3.2 ), nätmä çruteù  (2.3.18 ), and parät tu tac-chruteù\\n(2.3.40 ). The first aphorism ind icates the field of activities, the second\\nindicates the living entity, and the third indicates the Supreme Lord, the\\nsummum bonum  among all the manifestations of various entities.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

All Rights Reserved.summary, to be the field of activities and its interactions.\\nPURPORT\\nFrom all the authoritative statements of the great sages, the Vedic hymns\\nand the aphorisms of the Vedänta-sütra,  the components of this world can be\\nunderstood as follows. First there are ea rth, water, fire, air and ether. These are\\nthe five great element s (mahä-bhüta ). Then there are false ego, intelligence\\nand the unmanifested stage of the thr ee modes of nature. Then there are five\\nsenses for acquiring knowledge: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. Then\\nfive working senses: voice, legs, hands, anus an d genitals. Then, above the\\nsenses, there is the mind, which is wi thin and which can be called the sense\\nwithin. Therefore, including the mind, there are eleven senses altogether.\\nThen there are the five objects of the senses: smell, taste, form, touch and\\nsound. Now the aggregate of these twenty-four elements is called the field of\\nactivity. If one makes an analytical stud y of these twenty-four subjects, then he\\ncan very well understand the field of activity. Then there are desire, hatred,\\nhappiness and di stress, which are interactions, representations of the five great\\nelements in the gross body. The living symptoms, represented by consciousness\\nand conviction, are the manifestation of the subtle body—mind, ego and\\nintelligence. These subtle elements are i ncluded within the field of activities.\\nThe five great elements are a gross repr esentation of the false ego, which in\\nturn represents the primal stage of fals e ego technically called the materialistic\\nconception, or tämasa-buddhi,  intelligence in ignorance. This, further,\\nrepresents the unmanife sted stage of the three modes of material nature. The\\nunmanifested modes of material nature are called pradhäna.\\nOne who desires to know the twenty-four elements in detail along with\\ntheir interactions should study th e philosophy in more detail. In Bhagavad-gétä,\\na summary only is given.\\nThe body is the representation of all these factors, and there are changes of\\nthe body, which are six in number: the body is born, it grows, it stays, it\\nproduces by-products, then it begins to decay, and at the last stage it vanishes.\\nTherefore the field is a nonpermanent material thing. However, the kñetra-jïa,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

But actually this is the real\\nprocess of knowledge. If one accepts this process, then the possibility of\\napproaching the Absolut e Truth exists. This is not the interaction of the\\ntwenty-four elements, as described before. This is actually the means to get out\\nof the entanglement of those elements. The embodied soul is entrapped by the\\nbody, which is a casing made of the twenty-four  elements, and the process of\\nknowledge as described here is the means to get out of it. Of all the\\ndescriptions of the process of knowledge,  the most important point is described\\nin the first line of the eleventh verse. Mayi cänanya-yogena bhaktir\\navyabhi cäriëé:  the process of knowledge term inates in unalloyed devotional\\nservice to the Lord. So if one does not a pproach, or is not able to approach, the\\ntranscendental service of the Lord, th en the other nineteen items are of no\\nparticular value. But if one t akes to devotional service in full Kåñëa\\nconsciousness, the other nineteen item s automatically develop within him. As\\nstated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (5.18.12 ), yasyästi bhaktir bhagavaty akiïcanä\\nsarvair guëais tatra samäsate suräù.  All the good qualities of knowledge develop\\nin one who has attained the stage of devotional service. The principle ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.accepting a spiritual master, as mentione d in the eighth verse, is essential.\\nEven for one who takes to devotional service, it is most important.\\nTranscendental lif e begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master. The\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kå ñëa, clearly states here that this\\nprocess of knowledge is the actual path . Anything speculated beyond this is\\nnonsense.\\nAs for the knowledge outlined here, th e items may be analyzed as follows.\\nHumility means that one should not be  anxious to have the satisfaction of\\nbeing honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager\\nto receive honor from others, b ut from the point of view of a man in perfect\\nknowledge—who knows that he is not this body—anything, honor or\\ndishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. One should not be hankering after\\nthis material deception. People are very anxious to be famous for their religion,\\nand consequently sometimes it is fo und that without understanding the\\nprinciples of religion one enters in to some group which is not actually\\nfollowing religious principles and then wa nts to advertise himself as a religious\\nmentor. As for a ctual advancement in spiritual sc ience, one should have a test\\nto see how far he is progressing. He can judge by these items.\\nNonviolence is generally taken to mean  not killing or destroying the body,\\nbut actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress. People in\\ngeneral are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they\\nperpetually suffer material pain s. So unless one elevates people to spiritual\\nknowledge, one is practicing violence. On e should try his best to distribute real\\nknowledge to the people, so that they  may become enlightened and leave this\\nmaterial entanglement. That is nonviolence.\\nTolerance means that one should be pr acticed to bear insult and dishonor\\nfrom others. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge,\\nthere will be so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is expected\\nbecause material nature is so c onstituted. Even a boy like Prahläda, who, only\\nfive years old, was engaged in the cu ltivation of spiritual knowledge, was\\nendangered when his father became an tagonistic to his devotion. The father\\ntried to kill him in so many ways, but Prahläda tolerated him. So there may be\\nmany impediments to making advancement in spiritual knowledge, but weCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.should be tolerant and continue our progress with determination.\\nSimplicity means that without diplomac y one should be so straightforward\\nthat he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for acceptance of the\\nspiritual master, that is essential, be cause without the instruction of a bona\\nfide spiritual master one  cannot progress in the spiritual science. One should\\napproach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so\\nthat he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple. Because a\\nbona fide spiritual master is a representative of Kåñëa, if he bestows any\\nblessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced\\nwithout the disciple’s following the re gulative principles. Or, the regulative\\nprinciples will be easier for one wh o has served the spiritual master w ithout\\nreservation.\\nCleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life. There are\\ntwo kinds of cleanliness: external an d internal. External cleanliness means\\ntaking a bath, but for internal cleanline ss one has to think of Kåñëa always and\\nchant Hare Kåñëa, Hare  Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare\\nRäma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. This process cleans the accumulated dust of\\npast karma  from the mind.\\nSteadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in\\nspiritual life. Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress.\\nAnd self-control means that one sh ould not accept anything which is\\ndetrimental to the path of spiritual progress. One should become accustomed\\nto this and reject anything which is ag ainst the path of spiritual progress. This\\nis real renunciation. The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to\\nhave sense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not\\nnecessary. The senses should only be grat ified to keep the body fit so that one\\ncan discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life. The most important and\\nuncontrollable sense is the tongue. If one can control the tongue, then the re is\\nevery possibility of controlling the othe r senses. The function of the tongue is\\nto taste and to vibrate. Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should\\nalways be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kåñëa and\\nchanting Har e Kåñëa. As far as the eyes ar e concerned, they should not be\\nallowed to see anything but the beautifu l form of Kåñëa. That will control theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.eyes. Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about Kåñëa and the\\nnose in smelling the flowers offered to Kåñëa. This is the process of devotional\\nservice, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-gétä  is simply expounding the\\nscience of devotional service. Devo tional service is the main and sole\\nobjective. Unintelligent commentators on the Bhagavad-gétä  try to  divert the\\nmind of the reader to other subjec ts, but there is no other subject in\\nBhagavad-gétä  than devotional service.\\nFalse ego means accepting this body as  oneself. When one understands that\\nhe is not his body and is spirit soul, he comes to his real ego. Ego is there. False\\nego is condemned, but not real ego. In the Vedic literature ( Båhad-äraëyaka\\nUpaniñad  1.4.10 ) it i s said, ahaà brahmäsmi:  I am Brahman, I am spirit. This “I\\nam,” the sense of self, also exists in the liberated stage of self-realization. This\\nsense of “I am” is ego, but when the sense of “I am” is applied to this false body\\nit is false ego. When the sen se of self is applied to reality, that is real ego.\\nThere are some philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot\\ngive up our ego, because ego means iden tity. We ought, of course, to give up\\nthe false identification with the body.\\nOne should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age\\nand disease. There are descriptions in va rious Vedic literatures of birth. In the\\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam  the world of the unborn, the child’s stay in the womb of\\nthe mother, its suffer ing, etc., are all very graphically described. It should be\\nthoroughly understood that birth is distressful. Because we forget how much\\ndistress we have suffered within the womb  of the mother, we do not make any\\nsolution to the repetition of birth and deat h. Similarly at the time of death\\nthere are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the\\nauthoritative scriptures. These should be  discussed. And as far as disease and\\nold age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience. No one wants t o be\\ndiseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these.\\nUnless we have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the\\ndistresses of birth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our\\nmaking advancement in spiri tual life.\\nAs for detachment from children, wife  and home, it is not meant that one\\nshould have no feeling for these. They  are natural objects of affection. ButCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.when they are not favorable to spirit ual progress, then one should not be\\nattached to them. The best proce ss for making the home pleasant is Kåñëa\\nconsciousness. If one is in full Kåñëa consciousness, he can make his home very\\nhappy, because this process of Kåñëa cons ciousness is very easy. One need only\\nchant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Ha re Räma, Hare\\nRäma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to\\nKåñëa, have some discussion on books like Bhagavad-gétä  and\\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam,  and engage oneself in Deity worship. These four things\\nwill make one happy. One should tra in the members of his family in this way.\\nThe family members can sit down mo rning and evening and chant together\\nHare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma,\\nRäma Räma, Hare Hare. If one can mold his family life in this way to deve lop\\nKåñëa consciousness, following these four  principles, then there is no need to\\nchange from family life to renounced life. But if it is not congenial, not\\nfavorable for spiritual advancement, th en family life should be abandoned.\\nOne must sacrifice ever ything to realize or serve Kåñëa, just as Arjuna did.\\nArjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that\\nthese family members were impediments to his Kåñëa realization, he accepted\\nthe instruction of Kåñëa and fought and killed the m. In all cases, one should be\\ndetached from the happiness and distress of family life, because in this world\\none can never be fully happy or fully miserable.\\nHappiness and distress are concomitant fa ctors of material life. One should\\nlearn to tolerate, as advised in Bhagavad-gétä.  One can never restrict the\\ncoming and going of happiness and distre ss, so one should be detached from\\nthe materialistic way of life and be automatically equipoised in both cases.\\nGenerally, when we get something desirable we are very happy, and when we\\nget something undesirable we are distressed. But if we are actually in the\\nspiritual position these things will not agitate us. To reac h that stage, we have\\nto practice unbreakable devotional se rvice. Devotional service to Kåñëa\\nwithout deviation means engaging onesel f in the nine processes of devotional\\nservice—chanting, hearing, worshiping, offering respect, etc.—as described in\\nthe last verse  of the Ninth Chapter. That process should be followed.\\nNaturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual way of life, he will not wantCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

One may test\\nhimself by seeing how far he is inclined  to live in a solitary place, without\\nunwanted association. N aturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary\\nsporting or cinema-going or enjoying some social function, because he\\nunderstands that these are simply a waste of time. There are many research\\nscholars and philosophers who study sex life or some other subj ect, but\\naccording to Bhagavad-gétä  such research work and philosophical speculation\\nhave no value. That is more or  less nonsensical. According to Bhagavad-gétä,\\none should make research, by philosophi cal discretion, into the nature of the\\nsoul. One should  make research to understand the self. That is recommended\\nhere.\\nAs far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that\\nbhakti-yoga  is especially practical. As soon as there is a question of devotion,\\none must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual\\nsoul. The individual soul a nd the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the\\nbhakti  conception, the devotional concepti on of life. This service of the\\nindividual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam,  as it is clearly stated. So\\nbhakti,  or devotional service, is eternal. One  should be established in that\\nphilosophical conviction.\\nIn the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.2.11 ) this is explained. Vadanti tat tattva-vidas\\ntattvaà yaj jïänam advayam.  “Those who are actually knowers of the Absolute\\nTruth know that the Self is realized in three different phases, as Brahman,\\nParamätmä and Bhagavän.” B hagavän is the last word in the realization of the\\nAbsolute Truth; therefore one shou ld reach up to that platform of\\nunderstanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the\\ndevotional service of the Lord. That is the perfection of knowledge .\\nBeginning from practicing humility up  to the point of realization of the\\nSupreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of  Godhead, this process is just like a\\nstaircase beginning from the ground fl oor and going up to the top floor. Now\\non this staircase there ar e so many people who have reached the first floor, the\\nsecond or the third floor, etc., but un less one reaches the top floor, which is\\nthe understanding of Kåñëa, he is at a lower stage of knowledge. If anyone\\nwants to compete with God and at the same time  make advancement inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.spiritual knowledge, he will be frustrat ed. It is clearly stated that without\\nhumility, understanding is not truly po ssible. To think oneself God is most\\npuffed up. Although the living entity is  always being kicked by the stringent\\nlaws of material nature, he still thinks, “I am God” because of ignorance. The\\nbeginning of knowledge, therefore, is amänitva,  humility. One should be\\nhumble and know that he is subordinat e to the Supreme Lord. Due to rebellion\\nagainst the Supreme Lord, one b ecomes subordinate to material nature. One\\nmust know and be convinced of this truth.\\nTEXT  13\\njeYa& YataTPa[v+YaaiMa YaJjaTvaMa*TaMaénuTae )\\nANaaidMaTPar& b]ø Na SataàaSaduCYaTae )) 13 ))\\njïeyaà yat tat pravakñyämi\\nyaj jïätvämåtam açnute\\nanädi mat-paraà brahma\\nna sat tan näsad ucyate\\nSYNONYMS\\njïeyam —the knowable; yat—which; tat—that; pravakñyämi —I shall now\\nexplain; yat—which; jïätvä —knowing; amåtam —nectar; açnute —one tastes;\\nanädi —beginningless; mat-param —subordinate to Me; brahma —spirit;\\nna—neither; sat—cause; tat—that; na—nor; asat—effect; ucyate —is said to\\nbe.\\nTRANSLATION\\nI shall now explain the knowable, knowing which you will taste the eternal.\\nBrahman, the spirit, beginningless and subordinate to Me, lies beyond the cause\\nand effect of this material world.\\nPURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Now He begins to explain th e knowable, first the soul and then the\\nSupersoul. By knowledge of th e knower, both the soul and the Supersoul, one\\ncan relish the nectar of life. As expl ained in the Second Chapter, the living\\nentity is eternal. This is also confirmed here. There is no specific date at which\\nthe jéva was born. Nor can anyone trace out the history of the jévätmä’s\\nmanifestation from the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is beginningless. The\\nVedic literature confirms this: na jäyate mriyate vä vipaçcit  (Kaöha Upaniñad\\n1.2.18 ). The knower of the body is never born and never dies, and he is full of\\nknowledge.\\nThe Supreme Lord as the Supersoul is also stated in the Vedic literature\\n(Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  6.16) to be pradhäna-kñetrajïa-patir guëeçaù,  the chief\\nknower of the body and the master of the three modes of material nature. In\\nthe småti  it is said, däsa-b hüto harer eva nänyasvaiva kadäcana.  The living\\nentities are eternally in the service of the Supreme Lord. This is also\\nconfirmed by Lord Caitanya in His teachings.

There are unlimited heads, legs,\\nhands and eyes, and unlimited living enti ties. All are existing in and on the\\nSupersoul. Therefore the Supersoul is all-pervading. The individual soul,\\nhowever, cannot say that he has his hands, legs and eyes ev erywhere. That is\\nnot possible. If he thinks that under ignorance he is not conscious that his\\nhands and legs are diffused all over but when he attains to proper knowledge\\nhe will come to that stage, his thinking is contradictory. This means that the\\nindiv idual soul, having become conditioned by material nature, is not supreme.\\nThe Supreme is different from the in dividual soul. The Supreme Lord can\\nextend His hand without limit; the individual soul cannot. In Bhagavad-gétä\\nthe Lord says that if anyone offer s Him a flower, or a fruit, or a little water, He\\naccepts it. If the Lord is a far distance away, how can He accept things? This is\\nthe omnipotence of the Lord: even though He is situated in His own abode,\\nfar, far away from earth, He can extend His hand t o accept what anyone\\noffers. That is His potency. In the Brahma-saàhitä  (5.37) it is stated, goloka eva\\nnivasaty akhilätma-bhütaù:  although He is always engaged in pastimes in HisCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Actually, the individual\\nsouls have spiritual senses, but in cond itioned life they are covered with theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

His senses are\\ntranscendental and are therefore called nirguëa.  Guëa  means the material\\nmodes, but His senses are without material covering. It should be  understood\\nthat His senses are not exactly like ours . Although He is the source of all our\\nsensory activities, He has His transcendental senses, which are\\nuncontaminated. This is very nicely explained in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad\\n(3.19) in the verse apäëi -pädo javano grahétä.  The Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead has no hands which are mater ially contaminated, but He has His\\nhands and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to Him. That is the distinction\\nbetween the conditioned soul and the Supersoul. He has n o material eyes, but\\nHe has eyes—otherwise how could He see? He sees everything—past, present\\nand future. He lives within the heart of  the living being, and He knows what\\nwe have done in the past, what we ar e doing now, and what is awaiting us in\\nthe futur e. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä : He knows everything, but\\nno one knows Him. It is said that the Supreme Lord has no legs like us, but He\\ncan travel throughout space because He has spiritual legs. In other words, the\\nLord is not impersonal; He ha s His eyes, legs, hands and everything else, and\\nbecause we are part and parcel of the Su preme Lord we also have these things.\\nBut His hands, legs, eyes and senses are not contaminated by material nature.\\nBhagavad-gétä  also confirms that when the Lord appears He appears as He is\\nby His internal potency. He is not contaminated by the material energy,\\nbecause He is the Lord of material ener gy. In the Vedic literature we find that\\nHis whole embodiment is spiri tual. He has His eternal form, called\\nsac-cid-änanda-vigraha  [Bs. 5.1]. He is full of all opulence. He is the proprietor\\nof all wealth and the owner of all energy . He is the most intelligent and is full\\nof knowledge. These are some of the symptoms of the S upreme Personality of\\nGodhead. He is the maintainer of all living entities and the witness of all\\nactivity. As far as we can understand from Vedic literature, the Supreme Lord\\nis always transcendental. Although we do not see His head, face, hands or legs,\\nHe has them, and when we are elevated to the transcendental situation we can\\nsee the Lord’s form. Due to materially contaminated senses, we cannot see His\\nform. Therefore the impersonalists, who are still materially affected, cannotCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

But if one goes for\\nfive thousand miles in a ll directions and asks, “Where is the sun?” everyone\\nwill say that it is shining on his head.

Also\\nit is said in Vedic literature that one Vi ñëu is present everywhere by His\\nomnipotence, just as the sun appears in many places to many persons.

In the Vedic literature we\\nfind that in the spiritual kingdom there is no need of sun or moon, because the\\neffulgence of the Sup reme Lord is there. In the material world that\\nbrahmajyoti,  the Lord’s spiritual effulgence, is covered by the mahat-tattva,  the\\nmaterial elements; therefore in this mate rial world we require the assistance of\\nsun, moon, electricity, etc., for light. But i n the spiritual world there is no need\\nof such things. It is clearly stated in the Vedic literature that because of His\\nluminous effulgence, everything is illumi nated. It is clear, therefore, that His\\nsituation is not in the material world. He is situated in the spiritual world,\\nwhich is far, far away in the spiritual sk y. That is also confirmed in the Vedic\\nliterature. Äditya-varëaà tamasaù parastät  (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  3.8). He is\\njust like the sun, eternally luminous , but He is far, far beyond the dark ness of\\nthis material world.\\nHis knowledge is transcendental. Th e Vedic literature confirms that\\nBrahman is concentrated transcendental  knowledge. To one who is anxious to\\nbe transferred to that spiritual world, knowledge is given by the Supreme Lord,\\nwho is situated in everyone’s hea rt. One Vedic mantra  (Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad\\n6.18) says, taà ha devam ätma-buddhi-prakäçaà mumukñur vai çaraëam ahaà\\nprapadye.  One must surrender unto the Supr eme Personality of Godhead if he\\nat all wants liberation. As far as the goal of ultimate knowledge  is concerned, it\\nis also confirmed in Vedic literature: tam eva viditväti måtyum eti.  “Only byCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The Supreme\\nhas legs and hands distributed everywhere, and this cannot be said of the\\nindividual soul. Therefore that there are two knowers of the field of\\nactivity—the individual soul and the S upersoul—must be admitted. One’s\\nhands and legs are distributed locally, but Kåñëa’s hands and legs are\\ndistributed everywhere. This is confirmed in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad  (3.17):\\nsarvasya prabhum éçänaà sarvasya çaraëaà båhat.  That Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead, Supersoul, is the prabhu,  or master, of all living entities; therefore\\nHe is the ultimate shelter of all living entities.

Combined, these are called vijïäna,  or the science of knowledge.\\nPerfect knowledge can be unders tood by the unalloyed devotees of the Lord\\ndirectly. Others are unable to understa nd. The monists say that at the ultimate\\nstage these three items become one, but the devotees do not accept this.\\nKnowledge and development of knowledge mean understanding on eself in\\nKåñëa consciousness. We are being led by material consciousness, but as soon\\nas we transfer all consciousness to Kåñëa’s activities and realize that Kåñëa is\\neverything, then we attain real knowledge. In other words, knowledge is\\nnothing but the p reliminary stage of understanding devotional service\\nperfectly. In the Fifteenth Chapter this will be very clearly explained.\\nNow, to summarize, one may understand that verses 6 and 7 , beginning\\nfrom mahä-bhütäni  and continuing through cetanä dhåtiù,  analyze the material\\nelements and certain manifestations of the symptoms of life. These combine to\\nform the body, or the field of a ctivities. And verses 8 through 12 , from\\namänitvam  through tattva-jïänärtha-darçanam,  describe the process of\\nknowledge for understanding both types of  knower of the field of activities,\\nnamely the soul and the Supersoul. Then verses 13 through 18 , beginni ng from\\nanädi mat-param  and continuing through hådi sarvasya viñöhitam,  describe the\\nsoul and the Supreme Lord, or the Supersoul.\\nThus three items have been described: the field of activity (the body), the\\nprocess of understanding, and both the so ul and the Supersoul. It is especially\\ndescribed here that only the unalloye d devotees of the Lord can understand\\nthese three items clearly . So for these devotees Bhagavad-gétä  is fully useful; it\\nis they who can attain the supreme goal, the nature of the Supreme Lord,\\nKåñëa.

The body is the field of  activity and is composed of material\\nnature. The individual sou l that is embodied and enjoying the activities of the\\nbody is the puruña,  or the living entity. He is one knower, and the other is the\\nSupersoul. Of course, it is to be unde rstood that both the Supersoul and the\\nindividual entity are different manifestatio ns of the Supreme Personality ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Godhead. The living entity is in the category of His energy, and the Supersoul\\nis in the category of His personal expansion.\\nBoth material nature and the living en tity are eternal. That is to say that\\nthey existed before the creation. The ma terial manifestation is from the energy\\nof the Supreme Lord, and so also are the living entities, but the living entities\\nare of the superio r energy. Both the living entities and material nature existed\\nbefore this cosmos was manifested. Ma terial nature was absorbed in the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, Mahä-Viñëu, and when it was required, it\\nwas manifested by the agency of mahat-tattva.  Sim ilarly, the living entities are\\nalso in Him, and because they are condit ioned, they are averse to serving the\\nSupreme Lord. Thus they are not allowed to enter into the spiritual sky. But\\nwith the coming forth of material nature these living entities are ag ain given a\\nchance to act in the material world an d prepare themselves to enter into the\\nspiritual world. That is the mystery of  this material creation. Actually the\\nliving entity is originally the spiritual part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but\\ndue to his rebellious nature, he is conditioned within material nature. It really\\ndoes not matter how these living entities or superior entities of the Supreme\\nLord have come in contact with mate rial nature. The Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead knows, however, how and why this actually took place. In the\\nscriptures the Lord says that those attracted by this material nature are\\nundergoing a hard struggle for existence.  But we should know it with certainty\\nfrom the descriptions of these few verses that all transformat ions and\\ninfluences of material nature by th e three modes are also productions of\\nmaterial nature.

There are 8,400,000 different species of life, and\\nthese varieties are creations of the ma terial nature. They arise from the\\ndifferent sensual pleasures o f the living entity, who thus desires to live in this\\nbody or that. When he is put into diffe rent bodies, he enjoys different kinds of\\nhappiness and distress. His material happiness and distress are due to his body,\\nand not to himself as he is. In his orig inal state there is no doubt of enjoyment;\\ntherefore that is his real state. Because of the desire to lord it over material\\nnature, he is in the material world. In the spiritual world there is no such\\nthing. The spiritual world is pure, but in the material  world everyone is\\nstruggling hard to acquire different kind s of pleasures for the body. It might be\\nmore clear to state that this body is the effect of the senses. The senses are\\ninstruments for gratifying desire. No w, the sum total—body and instrument\\nsenses—are offered by material nature, and as will be clear in the next verse,\\nthe living entity is blessed or damned with circumstances according to his past\\ndesire and activity. According to one’s desires and activities, material natureCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.places one in vario us residential quarters. The being himself is the cause of his\\nattaining such residential quarters an d his attendant enjoyment or suffering.\\nOnce placed in some particular kind of body, he comes under the control of\\nnature because the body, being matter, a cts according to the laws of nature. At\\nthat time, the living entity has no powe r to change that law. Suppose an entity\\nis put into the body of a dog. As soon as he is put into the body of a dog, he\\nmust act like a dog. He cannot act otherwise. And if the living entity is put\\ninto the body of a hog, then he is forced to eat stool and act like a hog.\\nSimilarly, if the living entity is put in to the body of a demigod, he must act\\naccording to his body. This is the law of  nature. But in all circumstances, the\\nSupersoul is with the individual soul. That is explained in the Vedas  (Muëòaka\\nUpaniñad  3.1.1) as follows: dvä suparëä sayujä sakhäyaù.  The Supreme Lord is so\\nkind upon the living entity that He always accompanies the individual soul\\nand in all circumstance s is present as the Supersoul, or Paramätmä.\\nTEXT  22\\nPauåz\" Pa[k*-iTaSQaae ih >au»e Pa[k*-iTaJaaNGau<aaNa( )\\nk-ar<a& Gau<aSa®ae_SYa SadSaÛaeiNaJaNMaSau )) 22 ))\\npuruñaù prakåti-stho hi\\nbhuìkte prakåti-jän guëän\\nkäraëaà guëa-saìgo ’sya\\nsad-asad-yoni-janmasu\\nSYNONYMS\\npuruñaù —the living entity; prakåti-sthaù —being situated in the material\\nenergy; hi—certainly; bhuìkte —enjoys; prakåti-jän —produced by the material\\nnature; guëän —the modes of nature; käraëam —the cause; guëa-saìgaù —the\\nassociation with the modes of nature; asya—of the living entity; sat-asat —in\\ngood and bad; yoni—species of life; janmasu —in births.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Thus he meets with good and evil among various species.\\nPURPORT\\nThis verse is very important for an un derstanding of how the living entities\\ntransmigrate from one body to another. It is explained in the Second Chapter\\nthat the living entity is transmigrating  from one body to another just as one\\nchanges dress. This chan ge of dress is due to his attachment to material\\nexistence. As long as he is captivated  by this false manifestation, he has to\\ncontinue transmigrating from one body to  another. Due to his desire to lord it\\nover material nature, he is put into such undesira ble circumstances. Under the\\ninfluence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod,\\nsometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic, as\\na saintly man, as a bug. This is go ing on. And in all cases the living e ntity\\nthinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the\\ninfluence of material nature.\\nH o w  h e  i s  p u t  i n t o  s u c h  d i f f e r e n t  b o dies is explained here. It is due to\\nassociation with the different modes of  nature. One has to rise, therefore,\\nabove the three material modes and be come situated in the transcendental\\nposition. That is called Kåñëa con sciousness. Unless one is situated in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness, his material consciousne ss will oblige him to transfer from one\\nbody to another because he has material  desires since time immemorial. But he\\nhas to change that conception . That change can be effec ted only by hearing\\nfrom authoritative sources. The best ex ample is here: Arjuna is hearing the\\nscience of God from Kåñëa. The living entity, if he submits to this hearing\\nprocess, will lose his long-cherished de sire to dominate material nature, and\\ngradua lly and proportionately, as he reduces his long desire to dominate, he\\ncomes to enjoy spiritual happiness. In a Vedic mantra  it is said that as he\\nbecomes learned in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, heCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

He is not an ordinary living entity.\\nBecause the monist philosophers take th e knower of the body to be one, they\\nthink that there is no  difference between the Supersoul and the individual\\nsoul. To clarify this, the Lord says that He is represented as the Paramätmä in\\nevery body. He is different from the individual soul; He is para,\\ntranscendental. The individual soul enjoys the activities  of a particular field,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.but the Supersoul is present not as finite enjoyer nor as one taking part in\\nbodily activities, but as the witness, overseer, permitter and supreme enjoyer.\\nHis name is Paramätmä, not ätmä,  and He is transcendental. It is distinctly\\nclear that the ätmä  and Paramätmä are different. The Supersoul, the\\nParamätmä, has legs and hands everywhere, but the individual soul does not.\\nAnd because the Paramätmä is the Supr eme Lord, He is present within to\\nsanction the individual soul’s desiring material enjoyment. Without the\\nsanction of the Supreme Soul, the indi vidual soul cannot do anything. The\\nindividual is bhukta,  or the sustained, and the Lord is bhoktä,  or the\\nmaintainer. There are innumerable living  entities, and He is staying in them\\nas a friend.\\nThe fact is that every individual living  entity is eternally part and parcel of\\nthe Supreme Lord, and both of them are ve ry intimately related as friends. But\\nthe living entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the Supreme Lord\\nand act independent ly in an attempt to dominate nature, and because he has\\nthis tendency he is called the marginal  energy of the Supreme Lord. The living\\nentity can be situated either in the mate rial energy or in the spiritual energy.\\nAs long as he is conditioned by the mate rial energy, the Supreme Lord, as his\\nfriend, the Supersoul, stays with him just  to get him to return to the spiritual\\nenergy. The Lord is always eager to take  him back to the spiritual energy, but\\ndue to his minute independence the individual entity is co ntinually rejecting\\nthe association of spiritual light. This misuse of independence is the cause of\\nhis material strife in the conditioned nature. The Lord, therefore, is always\\ngiving instruction from within and fr om without. From without He gives\\ninstruc tions as stated in Bhagavad-gétä,  and from within He tries to convince\\nthe living entity that his activities in  the material field are not conducive to\\nreal happiness. “Just give it up and turn your faith toward Me. Then you will be\\nhappy,” He says. Thus t he intelligent person who places his faith in the\\nParamätmä or the Supreme Personality of Godhead begins to advance toward\\na blissful eternal life of knowledge.\\nTEXT  24Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

But there are other s, who are faithful in their understanding of\\nspiritual life, and they are called intr ospective devotees, philosophers, and\\nworkers who have renounced fruitive resu lts. Those who always try to establish\\nthe doctrine of monism are also counted among the ath eists and agnostics. InCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Of course there are those who try to understand the\\nSupreme Absolute Truth by cultivat ion of knowledge, and they can be\\ncounted in the class of the faithful. The Sä ìkhya philosophers analyze this\\nmaterial world into twenty-four elements , and they place the individual soul as\\nthe twenty-fifth item. When they are able to understand the nature of the\\nindividual soul to be transcendental  to the material elements, they ar e able to\\nunderstand also that above the individual soul there is the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead. He is the twen ty-sixth element. Thus gradually they\\nalso come to the standard of devotional  service in Kåñëa consciousness. Those\\nwho work without fruitiv e results are also perfect in their attitude. They are\\ngiven a chance to advance to the platform of devotional service in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness. Here it is stated that there are some people who are pure in\\nconsciousness and who try to find out the Supersoul by meditation, and when\\nthey discover the Supersoul within th emselves, they become transcendentally\\nsituated. Similarly, there are others who also try to understand the Supreme\\nSoul by cultivation of knowledge, an d there are others who cultivate the\\nhaöha- yoga system and who try to satisfy th e Supreme Personality of Godhead\\nby childish activities.\\nTEXT  26\\nANYae TvevMaJaaNaNTa\" é[uTvaNYae>Ya oPaaSaTae )\\nTae_iPa caiTaTarNTYaev Ma*TYau& é[uiTaParaYa<aa\" )) 26 ))\\nanye tv evam ajänantaù\\nçrutvänyebhya upäsate\\nte ’pi cätitaranty eva\\nmåtyuà çruti-paräyaëäùCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Some of the\\npeople may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical, but actually\\nthere is no knowledge of phil osophy. As for the common man, if he is a good\\nsoul, then there is a chance for advanc ement by hearing. This hearing process\\nis very important. Lord Caitanya, wh o preached Kåñëa consciousness in the\\nmodern world, gave great stress to hearing because if the  common man simply\\nhears from authoritative sources he can progress, especially, according to Lord\\nCaitanya, if he hears the transcendental vibration Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa,\\nKåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. It\\nis stated, therefore, that all men should take advantage of hearing from\\nrealized souls and gradually become able to understand everything. The\\nworship of the Supreme Lord will then undoubtedly take place. Lord Caitanya\\nhas said that in this age no one needs to chang e his position, but one should\\ngive up the endeavor to understand the Absolute Truth by speculative\\nreasoning. One should learn to become the servant of those who are inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.knowledge of the Supreme Lord. If one is fortunate enough to take shelter of a\\npure de votee, hear from him about self-realization and follow in his footsteps,\\none will be gradually elevated to the position of a pure devotee. In this verse\\nparticularly, the process of hearing is strongly recommended, and this is very\\nappropriate. Although th e common man is often not as capable as so-called\\nphilosophers, faithful hearing from an authoritative person will help one\\ntranscend this material existence and go back to Godhead, back to home.\\nTEXT  27\\nYaavTSaÅaYaTae ik-iÄTSatv& SQaavrJa®MaMa( )\\n+ae}a+ae}ajSa&YaaeGaataiÜiÖ >arTazR>a )) 27 ))\\nyävat saïjäyate kiïcit\\nsattvaà sthävara-jaìgamam\\nkñetra-kñetrajïa-saàyogät\\ntad viddhi bharatarñabha\\nSYNONYMS\\nyävat —whatever; saïjäyate —comes into being; kiïcit —anything;\\nsattvam —existence; sthävara —not moving; jaìgamam —moving; kñetra —of\\nthe body; kñetra-jïa —and the knower of the body; saàyogät —by the union\\nbetween; tat viddhi —you must know it; bharata-åñabha —O ch ief of the\\nBhäratas.\\nTRANSLATION\\nO chief of the Bhäratas, know that what ever you see in existence, both the\\nmoving and the nonmoving, is only a combination of the field of activities and\\nthe knower of the field.\\nPURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Here in Bhagavad-gétä\\nthe example of the sun and the sunshine is  given. As the sun is situated in one\\nplace but is illuminating the whole univer se, so a small particle of spirit soul,\\nalthough situated in  the heart of this body, is illuminating the whole body by\\nconsciousness. Thus consciousness is th e proof of the presence of the soul, as\\nsunshine or light is the proof of the presence of the sun. When the soul is\\npresent in the body, there is consciousnes s all over the body, and as soon as the\\nsoul has passed from the body there is  no more consciousness. This can be\\neasily understood by any intelligent man. Therefore consciousness is not a\\nproduct of the combinations of ma tter.

A spiritual master, by various\\ninstructions, teaches his students to get free from the material concept of life.\\nFor instance, in Bhagavad-gétä  we find Kåñëa instructing Arjuna to free him\\nfrom materialistic considerations.\\nOne can understand that this body is matter; it can be analyzed with its\\ntwenty-four elements.

And the symptoms of life\\nare the interaction of these fe atures. But over and above this, there is the soul,\\nand there is also the Supersoul. The soul and the Supersoul are two. This\\nmaterial world is working by the conjun ction of the soul and the twenty-four\\nmaterial elements. One who can see the constitution o f the whole material\\nmanifestation as this combination of th e soul and material elements and can\\nalso see the situation of the Supreme Soul  becomes eligible for transfer to the\\nspiritual world.

Knowledge which is not\\ncontaminated by the three modes of nature is called transcendental\\nknowledge. As soon as one is situated in that trans cendental knowledge, he is\\non the same platform as the Supreme Person. Those who have no knowledge of\\nthe spiritual sky hold that after being fr eed from the material activities of the\\nmaterial form, this spiritual iden tity becomes formless, without any\\nvariegatedness. However, just as there is material variegatedness in this world,\\nin the spiritual world there is also va riegatedness. Those in ignorance of this\\nthink that spiritual existence is oppose d to material variety. But actually, in\\nthe spiritual sky,  one attains a spiritual form. There are spiritual activities, and\\nthe spiritual situation is called devotional  life. That atmosphere is said to be\\nuncontaminated, and there one is equal in quality with the Supreme Lord.

This\\ncombination of material nature and the living entity is made possible by the\\nSupreme God Himself. The mahat-tattva  is the total cause of the total cosmic\\nmanifestation; and that total substance of the material cause, in which there\\nare three modes of nature, is sometimes called Brahman. The Supreme\\nPersonality impregnates that total substance, and thus innum erable universes\\nbecome possible. This total material substance, the mahat-tattva,  is described as\\nBrahman in the Vedic literature ( Muëòaka Upaniñad  1.1.19 ): tasmäd etad\\nbrahma näma-rüpam annaà ca jäyate.  The Supreme Person impregnates that\\nBrahman with th e seeds of the living entiti es. The twenty-four elements,\\nbeginning from earth, water, fire and air, are all material energy, and they\\nconstitute what is called mahad brahma,  or the great Brahman, the material\\nnature. As explained in the Seventh Chapter , beyond this there is another,\\nsuperior nature—the living entity. Into material nature the superior nature is\\nmixed by the will of the Supreme Person ality of Godhead, and thereafter all\\nliving entities are born of this material nature.\\nThe scorpion lays its eggs in piles of rice, and sometimes it is said that the\\nscorpion is born out of rice. But the rice is not the cause of the scorpion.\\nActually, the eggs were laid by the mother. Similarly, material nature is not\\nthe cause of the birth  of the living entities. The seed is given by the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead, and they only seem to come out as products ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.material nature. Thus every living entity , according to his past activities, has a\\ndifferent body, created by this material natu re, so that the entity can enjoy or\\nsuffer according to his past deeds.

Those situated in that\\nmode become conditioned by a sense of happiness and knowledge.\\nPURPORT\\nThe living entities conditioned by mate rial nature are of various types. One\\nis happy, another is very active, and another is helpless. All these types of\\npsychological manifestations are causes of the entities’ conditioned status inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.nature. How they are d ifferently conditioned is explained in this section of\\nBhagavad-gétä.  The mode of goodness is first considered. The effect of\\ndeveloping the mode of goodness in th e material world is that one becomes\\nwiser than those otherwise co nditioned. A man in the mod e of goodness is not\\nso much affected by material miseries , and he has a sense of advancement in\\nmaterial knowledge. The representative type is the brähmaëa,  who is supposed\\nto be situated in the mode of good ness. This sense of happiness is due to\\nundersta nding that, in the mode of goodne ss, one is more or less free from\\nsinful reactions. Actually, in the Vedic literature it is said that the mode of\\ngoodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness.\\nThe difficulty here is that when a livi ng entity is situated in the mode of\\ngoodness he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge and\\nis better than others. In this way he becomes conditioned. The best examples\\nare the scientist and the philosopher. Each is very proud of his knowledge, and\\nbecause they generally improve their li ving conditions, they feel a sort of\\nmaterial happiness. This sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life\\nmakes them bound by the mode  of goodness of material nature. As such, they\\nare attracted toward working in the mode  of goodness, and, as long as they\\nhave an attraction for working in that way, they have to take some type of\\nbody in the modes of nature. Thus there is no likelihood of liberation, or of\\nbeing transferred to the spiritual world. Repeatedly one may become a\\nphilosopher, a scientist or a poet, and re peatedly become entangled in the same\\ndisadvantages of birth and death. But, due to the illusion of the material\\nenergy, one thinks that that sort of life is pleasant.\\nTEXT  7\\nrJaae raGaaTMak&- iviÖ Ta*Z<aaSa®SaMauÙvMa( )\\nTaiàbDNaaiTa k-aENTaeYa k-MaRSa®eNa deihNaMa( )) 7 ))\\nrajo rägätmakaà viddhi\\ntåñëä-saìga-samudbhavam\\ntan nibadhnäti kaunteyaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Woman has attraction for man,  and man has attraction for woman.\\nThis is called the mode of passion. And when the mode of passion is increased,\\none develops the hankering for mate rial enjoyment. He wants to enjoy sense\\ngratification. For sense gratification, a man in the mode of passion wants some\\nhonor in society, or in the nation, and he wants to have a happy family, with\\nnice children, wife and house. These are the products of t he mode of passion.\\nAs long as one is hankering after these things, he has to work very hard.\\nTherefore it is clearly stated here that he becomes associated with the fruits of\\nhis activities and thus becomes bound by such activities. In order to please his\\nwife, children and society and to keep up his prestige, one has to work.\\nTherefore, the whole material world is more or less in the mode of passion.\\nModern civilization is considered to be  advanced in the standard of the mode\\nof passion.

The results of this mode are madness,\\nindolence and sleep, which bind the conditioned soul.\\nPURPORT\\nIn this verse the specific application of the word tu is very significant. This\\nmeans that the mode of ignorance is a very peculiar qualification of the\\nembodied soul. The mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the mode of\\ngoodness. In the mode of goodn ess, by development of knowledge, one can\\nunderstand what is what, but the mode  of ignorance is just the opposite.\\nEveryone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes mad, and a\\nmadman cannot understand what is wh at.

For\\nexample, everyone can see t hat his grandfather has died and therefore he will\\nalso die; man is mortal. The children that  he conceives will also die. So death is\\nsure. Still, people are madly accumula ting money and working very hard all\\nday and night, not caring for the eternal spiri t. This is madness. In their\\nmadness, they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual\\nunderstanding. Such people are very la zy. When they are invited to associate\\nfor spiritual understanding, they are not much interested. They are not even\\nactive like the man who is controlled by the mode of passion. Thus another\\nsymptom of one embedded in the mode of ignorance is that he sleeps more\\nthan is required. Six hours of sleep is  sufficient, but a man in the mode of\\nignorance sleeps at least ten or twelve  hours a day. Such a man appears to be\\nalways dejected and is addicted to intoxicants and sleeping.

Therefore the\\nsages, who are free from all illusion, are situated in happiness. But activities in\\nthe mode of passion are simply miserable. Any activity for material happiness\\nis bound to be d efeated. If, for example, one wants to have a skyscraper, so\\nmuch human misery has to be undergone before a big skyscraper can be built.\\nThe financier has to take much troubl e to earn a mass of wealth, and those\\nwho are slaving to construct the building ha ve to render physical toil. The\\nmiseries are there. Thus Bhagavad-gétä  says that in any activity performed\\nunder the spell of the mode of passion, there is definitely great misery. There\\nmay be a little so-called mental happiness—“I have this house or this\\nmoney”—but this is not actual happiness.\\nAs far as the mode of ignorance is concerned, the performer is without\\nknowledge, and therefore all his activities result in present misery, and\\nafterwards he will go on toward animal life. Animal life is always miserable,\\nalthough, under the spell of the illusory energy, mäyä,  the animals do not\\nunderstand this. Slaughtering poor animals is also due to the mode of\\nignorance. The animal killers do not know that in the future the animal willCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.have a body suitable to kill them. That is the law of nature. In hu man society,\\nif one kills a man he has to be hanged. That is the law of the state. Because of\\nignorance, people do not perceive that  there is a complete state controlled by\\nthe Supreme Lord. Every living creature is a son of the Supreme Lord, and He\\ndoes n ot tolerate even an ant’s being killed. One has to pay for it. So\\nindulgence in animal killing for the tast e of the tongue is the grossest kind of\\nignorance. A human being has no need  to kill animals, because God has\\nsupplied so many nice things. If one in dulges in meat-eating anyway, it is to be\\nunderstood that he is acting in ignora nce and is making his future very dark.\\nOf all kinds of animal killing, the killing  of cows is most vicious because the\\ncow gives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk. Co w slaughter is an act of\\nthe grossest type of ignorance. In the Vedic literature ( Åg Veda  9.4.64 ) the\\nwords gobhiù préëita-matsaram  indicate that one who, being fully satisfied by\\nmilk, is desirous of killing the cow is in the grossest ignorance. There is also a\\nprayer in the Vedic literature that states:\\nnamo brahmaëya-deväya\\ngo-brähmaëa-hitäya ca\\njagad-dhitäya kåñëäya\\ngovindäya namo namaù\\n“My Lord, You are the well-wisher of the cows and the brähmaëas,  and You\\nare the well-wisher of the entire human society and world.” ( Viñëu Puräëa\\n1.19.65 ) The purport is that special mentio n is given in that prayer for the\\nprotection of the cows and the brähmaëas.  Brähmaëas  are the symbol of\\nspiritual education, and cows are the sy mbol of the most valuable food; these\\ntwo living creatures, the brähmaëas  and the cows, must be given all\\nprotection—that is real advancement of civilization. In modern human\\nsociety, spiritual knowledge is neglected, and cow killing is encouraged. It is to\\nbe understood, then, that human society is advancing in the wrong direction\\nand is clearing the path to its own co ndemnation. A civilization which guides\\nthe citizens to become  animals in their next lives is certainly not a human\\ncivilization. The present human civilization  is, of course, grossly misled by the\\nmodes of passion and ignorance. It is a very dangerous age, and all nationsCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Through Kåñëa consciousness, society\\nwill develop the mode of goodness. When the mode of goodness is developed,\\npeople will see things as they are. In the mode of ignorance, people are just like\\nanimals and cannot see things clearly. In  the mode of ignorance, for example,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.they do not see that by killing one anim al they are taking the chance of being\\nkilled by the same animal in the next life. Bec ause people have no education in\\nactual knowledge, they become irrespon sible. To stop this irresponsibility,\\neducation for developing the mode of goodness of the people in general must\\nbe there. When they are actually ed ucated in the mode of goodness, they  will\\nbecome sober, in full knowledge of thin gs as they are. Then people will be\\nhappy and prosperous. Even if the majo rity of the people aren’t happy and\\nprosperous, if a certain percentage of the population develops Kåñëa\\nconsciousness and becomes situat ed in the mode of goodness, then there is the\\npossibility for peace and prosperity all ov er the world. Otherwise, if the world\\nis devoted to the modes of passion an d ignorance, there can be no peace or\\nprosperity. In the mode of passion, people become gree dy, and their hankering\\nfor sense enjoyment has no limit. One can see that even if one has enough\\nmoney and adequate arrangements for sense gratification, there is neither\\nhappiness nor peace of mind. That is no t possible, because one is situated in\\nthe mo de of passion. If one wants happiness at all, his money will not help him;\\nhe has to elevate himself to the mo de of goodness by practicing Kåñëa\\nconsciousness. When one is engaged in the mode of passion, not only is he\\nmentally unhappy, but his profession and occupation are also very\\ntroublesome. He has to devise so many plans and schemes to acquire enough\\nmoney to maintain his status quo. This is all miserable. In the mode of\\nignorance, people become mad. Being distressed by their circumstances, they\\ntake shelter of intoxication, and thus they sink further into ignorance.

There is an uppe r planetary system, consisting of the\\nheavenly planets, where everyone is highly elevated. According to the degree\\nof development of the mode o f goodness, the living entity can be transferred to\\nvarious planets in this system. The highes t planet is Satyaloka, or Brahmaloka,\\nwhere the prime person of this universe, Lord Brahmä, resides. We have seen\\nalready that we can hardly calculate the wondrou s condition of life in\\nBrahmaloka, but the highest condition of life, the mode of goodness, can bring\\nus to this.\\nThe mode of passion is mixed. It is in the middle, between the modes of\\ngoodness and ignorance. A person is not always pure, but even if he should be\\npurely in the mode of passion, he will simp ly remain on this earth as a king or a\\nrich man. But because th ere are mixtures, one can also go down. People on this\\nearth, in the mode of passion or ig norance, cannot forcibly approach the\\nhigher planets by machine. In the mode of passion, there is also the chance of\\nbecoming mad in the next life.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The word tämasäù  is very significant here. Tämasäù  indicates\\nthose who stay continuously in the mode of ignorance witho u t  r i s i n g  t o  a\\nhigher mode.

By the instruction of a bona fide\\nspiritual master, a living entity can know of his spir itual position, his material\\nbody, his senses, how he is entrapped, and how he is under the spell of the\\nmaterial modes of nature. He is helpless,  being in the grip of these modes, but\\nwhen he can see his real position, th en he can attain to the transcende ntal\\nplatform, having the scope for spiritual li fe. Actually, the living entity is not\\nthe performer of different activities. He is forced to act because he is situated\\nin a particular type of body, conducted by some particular mode of material\\nnature.

With the association of a bona fide\\nspiritual master, he can see his real position, and by such an understanding he\\ncan become fixed in full Kåñëa c onsciousness. A man in Kåñëa consciousness is\\nnot controlled by the spell of the material modes of nature.

He wants to know the\\nsymptoms of a person who has alread y transcended the material modes. He\\nfirst inquires of the symptoms of such a transcendental person. How can one\\nunderstand that he has already transcended the influence of the modes of\\nmaterial nature? The second question asks how he lives and what his activities\\nare.

All Rights Reserved.PURPORT\\nArjuna submitted three different questions , and the Lord answers them one\\nafter another. In these verses, Kåñëa first indicates that a person\\ntranscendentally situated has no envy  and does not hanker for anything.\\nWhen a living entity stays in this materia l world embodied by the material\\nbody, it  is t o be underst ood t h at  h e is under the control of one of the three\\nmodes of material nature. When he is actually out of the body, then he is out\\nof the clutches of the material mo des of nature. But as long as he is not out of\\nthe material body, he should be neutral. He should engage himself in the\\ndevotional service of the Lord so that his identity with the material body will\\nautomatically be forgotten. When one is conscious of the material body, he\\nacts only for sense gratification, but when one transfers the consciousness to\\nKåñëa, sense gratification automatically stops. One does not need this material\\nbody, and he does not need to accept th e dictations of the material body. The\\nqualities of the material modes i n the body will act, but as spirit soul the self is\\naloof from such activities. How does he become aloof? He does not desire to\\nenjoy the body, nor does he desire to  get out of it. Thus transcendentally\\nsituated, the devotee becomes automatically free. He need not try to become\\nfree from the influence of the modes of material nature.\\nThe next question concerns the dealings of a transcendentally situated\\nperson. The materially situated person is affected by so-called honor and\\ndishonor offered to the body, but the tr anscendentally situated person is not\\naffected by such false honor and dishonor. He performs his duty in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness and does not mind whethe r a man honors or dishonors him. He\\naccepts things that are favorable for his duty in Kåñëa consciousness, otherwise\\nhe has no necessity of anything material, either a stone or g old. He takes\\neveryone as his dear friend who helps him in his execution of Kåñëa\\nconsciousness, and he does not hate his so-called enemy. He is equally disposed\\nand sees everything on an equal level because he knows perfectly well that he\\nhas nothing to d o with material existence. Social and political issues do not\\naffect him, because he knows the si tuation of temporary upheavals and\\ndisturbances. He does not attempt anything for his own sake. He can attemptCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.anything for Kåñëa, but for his personal self he  does not attempt anything. By\\nsuch behavior one becomes actually transcendentally situated.\\nTEXT  26\\nMaa& c Yaae_VYai>acare<a >ai¢-YaaeGaeNa SaevTae )\\nSa Gau<aaNSaMaTaqTYaETaaNb]ø>aUYaaYa k-LPaTae )) 26 ))\\nmäà ca yo ’vyabhicäreëa\\nbhakti-yogena sevate\\nsa guëän samatétyaitän\\nbrahma-bhüyäya kalpate\\nSYNONYMS\\nmäm —unto Me; ca—also; yaù—a person who; avyabhicäreëa —without fail;\\nbhakti-yogena —by devotional service; sevate —renders service; saù—he;\\nguëän —the modes of material nature; samatétya —transcending; etän—all\\nthese; brahma-bhüyäya —elevated to the Brahman plat form; kalpate —becomes.\\nTRANSLATION\\nOne who engages in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at\\nonce transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of\\nBrahman.\\nPURPORT\\nThis verse is a reply to Arjuna’s third question : What is the means of\\nattaining to the transcendental positi on?

All Rights Reserved.This includes not only Kåñëa, but His different p lenary expansions such as\\nRäma and Näräyaëa. He has innumerabl e expansions. One who is engaged in\\nthe service of any of the forms of Kå ñëa, or of His plenary expansions, is\\nconsidered to be transcendentally situat ed. One should also note that all the\\nforms  of Kåñëa are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal.\\nSuch personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they\\npossess all transcendental qualities. So if one engages himself in the service of\\nKåñëa or His plenary expans ions with unfailing determination, although these\\nmodes of material nature are very difficult to overcome, one can overcome\\nthem easily. This has alre ady been explained in the Seventh Chapter . One\\nwho surrenders unto Kåñëa at on ce surmounts the influence o f the modes of\\nmaterial nature. To be in Kåñëa consciousness or in devotional service means\\nto acquire equality with Kåñëa. The Lo rd says that His nature is eternal,\\nblissful and full of knowledge, and the livi ng entities are part and parcel of the\\nSupreme , as gold particles are part of a gold  mine. Thus the living entity, in his\\nspiritual position, is as good as gold, as good as Kåñëa in quality. The difference\\nof individuality continues, otherwise there would be no question of\\nbhakti-yoga.  Bhakti-yoga  mea ns that the Lord is there, the devotee is there and\\nthe activity of exchange of love betw een the Lord and the devotee is there.\\nTherefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise  there would be\\nno meaning to bhakti-yoga.  If one is not situated in the same transcendental\\nposition with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be a personal\\nassistant to a king, one must acquire th e qualifications. Thus the qualification\\nis to become Brahman, or freed from all ma terial contamination. It is said in\\nthe Vedic literature, brahmaiva san brahmäpy eti.  One can attain the Supreme\\nBrahman by becoming Brahman. This means that one must qualitatively\\nbecome one with Brahman. By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his\\neternal Brahman identity as an individual soul.\\nTEXT  27\\nb]ø<aae ih Pa[iTaïahMaMa*TaSYaaVYaYaSYa c )Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization.\\nParamätmä, the Supersoul, is the middl e, the second stage in transcendental\\nrealization, and the Supreme Personali ty of Godhead is the ultimate realization\\nof the Absolute Truth. Therefore, both Paramätmä and the impersonal\\nBrahman are within the Supreme Pe rson. It is explained in the Seventh\\nChapter  that material nature is the manife station of the inferior energy of the\\nSupreme Lord. The Lord impregnates the inferior, material nature with\\nfragments of the superior nature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material\\nnature. When a living entity conditione d by this material nature begins the\\ncultivation of spiritual  knowledge, he elevates himself from the position ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.material existence and gradually rises up to the Brahman conception of the\\nSupreme. This attainment of the Brahman conception of life is the first stage\\nin self-realization. At this stage the Brahman-rea lized person is transcendental\\nto the material position, but he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization.\\nIf he wants, he can continue to stay in the Brahman position and then\\ngradually rise up to Paramätmä realization and then to the realization of the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. There are many examples of this in Vedic\\nliterature. The four Kumäras were situ ated first in the impersonal Brahman\\nconception of truth, but then they grad ually rose to the platform of devotional\\nservice. One who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception of\\nBrahman runs the risk of falling down. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  it is stated that\\nalthough a person may rise to the stage of impersonal Brahman, without going\\nfurther, with no information of the Supreme Perso n, his intelligence is not\\nperfectly clear. Therefore, in spite of being raised to the Brahman platform,\\nthere is the chance of falling down if one is not engaged in the devotional\\nservice of the Lord. In the Vedic  language it is also said, raso vai saù, r asaà hy\\neväyaà labdhvänandé bhavati:  “When one understands the Personality of\\nGodhead, the reservoir of pleasure, Kåñëa, he actually becomes\\ntranscendentally blissful.” ( Taittiréya Upaniñad  2.7.1) The Supreme Lord is full\\nin six opulences, and when a devot ee approaches Him there is an exchange of\\nthese six opulences. The servant of the king enjoys on an almost equal level\\nwith the king. And so eternal happiness,  imperishable happiness, and eternal\\nlife accompany devotional service. Therefore, realization of  Brahman, or\\neternity, or imperishability, is included in devotional service. This is already\\npossessed by a person who is engaged in devotional service.\\nThe living entity, although Brahman by  nature, has the desire to lord it\\nover the material world, and due to th is he falls down. In his constitutional\\nposition, a living entity is above th e three modes of material nature, but\\nassociation with material natu re entangles him in the different modes of\\nmaterial nature—goodness, passion and ignorance. Due to the association of\\nthese three modes, his desire to dominate the material world is there. By\\nengagement in devotional service in full Kåñëa consciousness, he  is\\nimmediately situated in the transcendent al position, and his unlawful desire toCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.control material nature is removed. Therefore the process of devotional\\nservice, beginning with hearing, chanting, remembering—the prescribed nine\\nmethods for realizing dev otional service—should be practiced in the\\nassociation of devotees. Gradually, by such  association, by the influence of the\\nspiritual master, one’s material desire  to dominate is removed, and one\\nbecomes firmly situated in the Lord’s transcendental loving service. This\\nmethod is prescribed from the twenty-second  to the last verse of this chapter.\\nDevotional service to the Lord is very simple: one should always engage in the\\nservice of the Lord, should eat the remnan ts of foodstuffs offered to the Deity,\\nsmell the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, see the places where the\\nLord had His transcendental pastimes, re ad of the different activities of the\\nLord, His reciprocation of love with His devotees, chant always the\\ntranscendental vibration Hare K åñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/\\nHare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, and observe the fasting days\\ncommemorating the appearances and disappearances of the Lord and His\\ndevotees. By following such a proce ss one becomes completely detached fr om\\nall material activities. One who can thus situate himself in the brahmajyoti  or\\nthe different varieties of the Brahman conception is equal to the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead in quality.\\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourteenth Chapter of the Çrémad\\nBhagavad-gétä  in the matter of the Three Modes of Material Nature.\\n- CHAPTER 15 -\\nThe Yoga of the Supreme Person\\nTEXT  1Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Therefore one who is in Kåñëa\\nconsciousness, who is engaged in devotion al service, already knows the Vedas.\\nThe entanglement of this material world is compared here to a banyan tree.\\nFor one who is engaged in fruitive activities, there is no end to the banyanCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.tree. He wanders from one branch to another, to another, to another. The tree\\nof this material world has  no end, and for one who is attached to this tree,\\nthere is no possibility of liberation . The Vedic hymns, meant for elevating\\noneself, are called the leaves of this tr ee. This tree’s roots grow upward because\\nthey begin from where Brahmä is located, the t opmost planet of this universe.\\nIf one can understand this indestructible  tree of illusion, then one can get out\\nof it.\\nThis process of extrication should be understood. In the previous chapters it\\nhas been explained that there are many processes by which to get out of the\\nmaterial entanglement. And, up to the Thirteenth Chapter , we have seen that\\ndevotional service to the Supreme Lord is the best way. Now, the basic\\nprinciple of devotional service is detachment from material activities and\\nattachment to the transcendental servic e of the Lord. The process of breaking\\nattachment to the material world is discussed in the begin ning of this chapter.\\nThe root of this material existence gr ows upward. This means that it begins\\nfrom the total material substance, from the topmost planet of the universe.\\nFrom there, the whole universe is expanded, with so many branches,\\nrepresenting th e various planetary systems. The fruits represent the results of\\nthe living entities’ activities, namely, religion, economic development, sense\\ngratification and liberation.\\nNow, there is no ready experience in this world of a tree situated with its\\nbranches down and its roots upward, but there is such a thing. That tree can be\\nfound beside a reservoir of water. We can see that the trees on the bank reflect\\nupon the water with  their branches down and r oots up. In other words, the\\ntree of this material world is only a refl ection of the real tree of the spiritual\\nworld. This reflection of the spiritual worl d is situated on desire, just as a tree’s\\nreflection is situated on water.  Desire is the cause of things’ being situated in\\nthis reflected material light. One wh o wants to get out of this material\\nexistence must know this tree thorough ly through analytical study. Then he\\ncan cut off his relationship with it.\\nThis tree, being the reflection of the real tree, is an exact replica.\\nEverything is there in the spiritual world. The impersonalists take Brahman to\\nbe the root of this material tree, an d from the root, according to SäìkhyaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.philosophy, come prakåti, puruñ a, then the three guëas,  then the five gross\\nelements ( païca-mahä-bhüta ), then the ten senses ( daçendriya ), mind, etc. In\\nthis way they divide up the whole mate rial world into twenty-four elements. If\\nBrahman is the center of all manifestations, then this material world is a\\nmanifestation of the center by 18 0 degrees, and the other 180 degrees\\nconstitute the spiritual world. The material world is the perverted reflection,\\nso the spiritual world must have the same variegatedness, but in reality. The\\nprakåti  is the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and the puruña  is the\\nSupreme Lord Himself, and that is explained in Bhagavad-gétä.  Since this\\nmanifestation is material, it is temporar y. A reflection is temporary, for it is\\nsometimes seen and sometimes not see n. But the origin from whence the\\nreflection is reflected is eternal. The ma terial reflection of the real tree has to\\nbe cut off. When it is s aid that a person knows the Vedas,  it is assumed that he\\nknows how  to cut off attachment to this material world. I f one knows that\\nprocess, he actually knows the Vedas.  One who is attracted by the ritualistic\\nformulas of the Vedas  is attracted by the beautiful green leaves of the tree. He\\ndoes not exactly know the purpose of the Vedas.  The purpose of the Vedas,  as\\ndisclosed by the Personality of Godhead Hi mself, is to cut down this reflected\\ntree and attain the real tree of the spiritual world.\\nTEXT  2\\nADaêaeß| Pa[Sa*TaaSTaSYa Xaa%a Gau<aPa[v*Öa ivzYaPa[val/a\" )\\nADaê MaUl/aNYaNauSaNTaTaaiNa k-MaaRNaubNDaqiNa MaNauZYal/aeke- )) 2 ))\\nadhaç cordhvaà prasåtäs tasya çäkhä\\nguëa-pravåddhä viñaya-praväläù\\nadhaç ca müläny anusantatäni\\nkarmänubandhéni manuñya-loke\\nSYNONYMS\\nadhaù —downward; ca—and; ürdhvam —upward; prasåtäù —extended;Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

No one can\\nunderstand where it ends, where it begins , or where its foundation is. But with\\ndetermination one must cut down this strongly rooted tree with the weapon of\\ndetachment. Thereafter, on e must seek that place from which, having gone, one\\nnever returns, and there surrender to that Supreme Personality of Godhead\\nfrom whom everything began and from whom everything has extended since\\ntime immemorial.\\nPURPORT\\nIt is now clearly stated that the re al form of this banyan tree cannot be\\nunderstood in this material world. Sinc e the root is upwards, the extension of\\nthe real tree is at the other end. When  entangled with the material expansions\\nof the tree, one cannot see how far the tree extends, nor can one see the\\nbeginning of this tree. Yet one has to fi nd out the cause. “I am the son of my\\nfather, my father is the son of such-and-such a person, etc.” By searching in\\nthis way, one comes to Brahmä, who is generated b y the Garbhodakaçäyé\\nViñëu. Finally, in this way, when one reaches the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead, that is the end of research wo rk. One has to search out that origin of\\nthis tree, the Supreme Personality of  Godhead, through the association of\\npersons who are in knowledge of that Supr eme Personality of Godhead. Then\\nby understanding one becomes gradually detached from this false reflection of\\nreality, and by knowledge one can cut off the connection and actually become\\nsituated in the real tree.\\nThe word asaìga  is very important in this connection because the\\nattachment for sense enjoyment and lordin g it over the material nature is very\\nstrong. Therefore one must learn detachme nt by discussion of spiritual science\\nbased on authoritative scriptures , and one must hear from persons who are\\nactually in knowledge. As a result of  such discussion in the association of\\ndevotees, one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then the firstCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.thing one must do is surrender to  Him. The description of that pl ace whence\\nhaving gone one never returns to this false reflected tree is given here. The\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñë a, is the original root from whom\\neverything has emanated. To gain favor of that Personality of Godhead, one\\nhas only to surrender,  and this is a result of performing devotional service by\\nhearing, chanting, etc. He is the cause of the extension of the material world.\\nThis has already been explain ed by the Lord Himself. Ahaà sarvasya\\nprabhavaù : “I am the origin of everything.” Therefo re to get out of the\\nentanglement of this strong banyan tree of material life, one must surrender to\\nKåñëa.

The first\\nqualification is that one should no t be deluded by pride. Because the\\nconditioned soul is puffed up, thinking himself the lord of material nature, it is\\nvery difficult for him to surrender u nto the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\\nOne should know by the cultivation of real knowledge that he is not lord of\\nmaterial nature; the Supreme Personalit y of Godhead is the Lord. When one is\\nfree from delusion caused by pride, he can begin the process of  surrender. For\\none who is always expecting some honor in this material world, it is not\\npossible to surrender to the Supreme Person. Pride is due to illusion, for\\nalthough one comes here, stays for a brief time and then goes away, he has the\\nfoolish notio n that he is the lord of the world. He thus makes all things\\ncomplicated, and he is always in tr ouble. The whole world moves under this\\nimpression. People are considering the land, this earth, to belong to human\\nsociety, and they have divided the land unde r the false impression that they\\nare the proprietors. One has to get out of  this false notion that human society\\nis the proprietor of this world. When one is freed from such a false notion, he\\nbecomes free from all the false associations caused by familial , social and\\nnational affections. These faulty associations bind one to this material world.\\nAfter this stage, one has to develop spiritual knowledge. One has to cultivate\\nknowledge of what is actually his own and what is actually not his own. And\\nwhen one  has an understanding of things as they are, he becomes free from all\\ndual conceptions such as happiness and distress, pleasure and pain. He\\nbecomes full in knowledge; then it is  possible for him to surrender to the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead.\\nTEXT  6Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

We have only one planet in this\\nuniverse, the sun, which is self-luminous,  but all the planets in the spiritual sky\\nare self-luminous. The shining effulg ence of all those planets (called\\nVaikuëöhas) constitutes the shining sky known as the brahm ajyoti.  Actually,\\nthe effulgence is emanating from the pl anet of Kåñëa, Goloka Våndävana. Part\\nof that shining effulgence is covered by the mahat-tattva,  the material world.\\nOther than this, the major portion of that shining sky is full of spiritual\\nplanet s, which are called Vaikuëöhas, chief of which is Goloka Våndävana.\\nAs long as a living entity is in this da rk material world, he is in conditionalCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Then there is no\\nchance of his comi ng back here. In his conditional life, the living entity\\nconsiders himself to be the lord of this material world, but in his liberated state\\nhe enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes an associate of the Supreme\\nLord. There he enjoys eternal bliss, e ternal life, and full knowledge.\\nOne should be captivated by this info rmation. He should desire to transfer\\nhimself to that eternal world and extricat e himself from this false reflection of\\nreality. For one who is too much attached  to this material world, it is very\\ndifficult to cut that attachment, but if he takes to Kåñëa consciousness there is\\na chance of gradually becoming detach ed. One has to associate himself with\\ndevotees, those who are in Kåñëa cons ciousness. One should search out a\\nsociety dedicated to Kåñëa consciousness and lear n how to discharge\\ndevotional service. In this way he can cut off his attachment to the material\\nworld. One cannot become detached from the attraction of the material world\\nsimply by dressing himself in saffron cl oth. He must become attached to the\\ndevotio nal service of the Lord. Therefore one should take it very seriously that\\ndevotional service as described in the Twelfth Chapter  is the only way to get\\nout of this false representation of the real tree. In Chapter Fourteen  the\\ncontamination of all kinds of  processes by material nature is described. Only\\ndevotional service is described as purely transcendental.\\nThe words paramaà mama  are very important here. Actually every nook\\nand corner is the property of the Su preme Lord, but the spiritual world is\\nparamam,  full of six opulences. The Kaöha Upaniñad  (2.2.15 ) also confirms that\\nin the spiritual world there is no  need of sunshine, moonshine or stars ( na\\ntatra süryo bhäti na candratärakam ), for the whole spiritual sky is illuminated\\nby the internal potency of the Supr eme Lord.

According to the Vedic version, the Supreme Lord\\nmanifests and expands Himself in i nnumerable expansions, of which the\\nprimary expansions are called viñëu-tattva  and the secondary  expansions are\\ncalled the living entities. In other words, the viñëu-tattva  is the personal\\nexpansion, and the living entities are the separated expansions. By His\\npersonal expansion, He is manifested  in various forms like Lord Räma,\\nNåsiàhadeva, Viñëumür ti and all the predominatin g Deities in the VaikuëöhaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.planets. The separated expansions, the living entities, are eternally servitors.\\nThe personal expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the\\nindividual identities of the Godhead, are always prese nt. Similarly, the\\nseparated expansions of living entities have their identities. As fragmental\\nparts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities also have fragmental\\nportions of His qualities, of which inde pendence is one. Every living entity, as\\nan individual soul, has his personal  individuality and a minute form of\\nindependence. By misuse of that in dependence one becomes a conditioned\\nsoul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated. In either case,\\nhe is qualitatively eternal, as the Supreme Lord is. In his liberated state he is\\nfreed from this material condition, and he is under the engagement of\\ntranscendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned life he is dominated\\nby the material modes of nature, and he forgets the transc endental loving\\nservice of the Lord. As a result, he has to struggle very hard to maintain his\\nexistence in the material world.\\nThe living entities, not only human be ings and the cats and dogs, but even\\nthe greater controllers of the material world—Brahmä, Lord Çiva and even\\nViñëu—are all parts and parcels of the Su preme Lord. They are all eternal, not\\ntemporary manifestations. The  word karñati  (“struggling” or “grappling hard”)\\nis very significant. The conditioned so ul is bound up, as though shackled by\\niron chains. He is bound up by the false ego, and the mind is the chief agent\\nwhich is driving him in this  material existence. Whe n the mind is in the mode\\nof goodness, his activities are good; when the mind is in the mode of passion,\\nhis activities are troublesome; and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance,\\nhe travels in the lower species of life. It is clear, however, in this v erse, that the\\nconditioned soul is covered by the ma terial body, with the mind and the\\nsenses, and when he is liberated this  material covering perishes, but his\\nspiritual body manifests itself in its individual capacity. The following\\ninformation is there in the Mädhyandinäyana-çruti:  sa vä eña brahma-niñöha\\nidaà çaréraà martyam atisåjya brahmäb hisampadya brahmaëä paçyati brahmaëä\\nçåëoti brahmaëaivedaà sarvam anubhavati.  It is stated here that when a living\\nentity gives up this material embodiment and enter s into the spiritual world,\\nhe revives his spiritual body, and in hi s spiritual body he can see the SupremeCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Personality of Godhead face to face. He can hear and speak to Him face to\\nface, and he can understand the Supreme Personality as He is. From småti  also\\nit is understood, vasanti yatra puruñäù sarve vaikuëöha-mürtayaù:  in the\\nspiritual planets everyone lives in bodies  featured like the Supreme Personality\\nof Godhead’s. As far as bodily constructi on is concerned, there is no difference\\nbetween the part- and-parcel living entities and the expansions of viñëu-mürti.\\nIn other words, at liberation the living entity gets a spiritual body by the grace\\nof the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\\nThe words mamaiväàçaù  (“fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme\\nLord”) are also very significant. The fr agmental portion of the Supreme Lord is\\nnot like some material broken part. We have already understood in the Second\\nChapter  that the spirit cannot be cut into pieces. This fragment is not\\nmaterially conceived. It is not like matter, which can be cut into pieces and\\njoined together again. That conception is not applicable here, because the\\nSanskrit word sanätana  (“eternal”) is used. The fragmental por tion is eternal.\\nIt is also stated in the beginning of th e Second Chapter that in each and every\\nindividual body the fragmental portio n of the Supreme Lord is present ( dehino\\n’smin yathä dehe ). That fragmental portion, when liberated from the bodily\\nentang lement, revives its original spiritua l body in the spiritual sky in a\\nspiritual planet and enjoys association with the Supreme Lord. It is, however,\\nunderstood here that the living entity, being the fragmental part and parcel of\\nthe Supreme Lord, is qualit atively one with the Lord , just as the parts and\\nparcels of gold are also gold.\\nTEXT  8\\nXarqr& YadvaPanaeiTa YaÀaPYauT§-aMaTaqìr\" )\\nGa*hqTvETaaiNa Sa&YaaiTa vaYauGaRNDaaiNavaXaYaaTa( )) 8 ))\\nçaréraà yad aväpnoti\\nyac cäpy utkrämatéçvaraù\\ngåhétvaitäni saàyäti\\nväyur gandhän iväçayätCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

That is discussed in the Brahma-saàhitä.  It is said there that one\\nplenary portion of the S upreme Personality of Godhead, Paramätmä, enters\\ninto the planets, the universe, the livi ng entity, and even into the atom. So\\ndue to His entrance, everything is appropriately manifested. When the spirit\\nsoul is there, a living man can float on the water, but when the living spark is\\nout of the body and the body is dead, the body sinks. Of course when it is\\ndecomposed it floats just like straw an d other things, but as soon as the man is\\ndead, he at once sinks in the water. Similarly, all these planets are f loating in\\nspace, and this is due to the entrance  of the supreme energy of the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead. His energy is  sustaining each planet, just like a\\nhandful of dust. If someone holds a handful of dust, there is no possibility of\\nthe dust’s fall ing, but if one throws it in th e air it will fall down. Similarly,\\nthese planets, which are floating in the air, are actually held in the fist of the\\nuniversal form of the Supreme Lord.

It is said in the Vedic hymns that\\nbecause of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the sun is shining and the\\nplanets are steadily moving.

As long as a living entity is conditioned, his body changes due to\\ncontact with matter; matter is changing, so the living entity appears to be\\nchanging. But in the spiritua l world the body is not m ade of matter; therefore\\nthere is no change. In the material world the living entity undergoes six\\nchanges—birth, growth, duration, reproduction, then dwindling and\\nvanishing. These are the changes of th e material body. But in the spiritual\\nworld the body does not change; there is no old age, there is no birth, there is\\nno death. There all exists in oneness. Kñaraù sarväëi bhütäni:  any living entity\\nwho has come in contact with matter, be ginning from the first created being,\\nBrahmä, down to a small ant, is changing its body; therefore they are all\\nfallible. In the spiritual world, however, they are always liberated in oneness.\\nTEXT  17Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Now in this\\nverse the Supreme Personality of Godh ead clearly explains that anyone who\\nknows Lord Kåñëa to be the Supreme Pers on is actually the knower of\\neverything. The imperfect knower goes on simply speculating about the\\nAbsolute Truth, but the perfect knowe r, without wasting his valuable time,\\nengages directly in Kåñëa consciousness,  the devotional service of the Supreme\\nLord. Throughout the whole of Bhagavad-gétä,  this fact is being stressed at\\nevery step. And still there are so  many stubborn commentators on\\nBhagavad-gétä  who consider the Supreme Ab solute Truth and the living\\nentities to be one and the same.\\nVedic knowledge is called çruti,  learning by aural reception. One should\\nactually receive the Vedic message fr om authorities like Kåñëa and His\\nrepresentatives. Here Kåñëa distinguishes everything very nicely, and one\\nshould hear from this source. Simply t o hear like the hogs is not sufficient; one\\nm u s t  b e  a b l e  t o  u n d e r s t a n d  f r o m  t h e  authorities. It is not that one should\\nsimply speculate academically. On e should submissively hear from\\nBhagavad-gétä  that these living entities are always subordinate to the S upreme\\nPersonality of Godhead. Anyone who is able to understand this, according to\\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, knows the purpose of the\\nVedas;  no one else knows the purpose of the Vedas.\\nThe word bhajati  is very significant. In many places the word bhajati  is\\nexpressed in relationship with the serv ice of the Supreme Lord. If a person isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

In the\\nVaiñëava paramparä it is said that if on e is engaged in the devotional service of\\nKåñëa, then there is no need for any other spiritual process for understanding\\nthe Supreme Absolute Truth. He has already co me to the point, because he is\\nengaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He has ended all preliminary\\nprocesses of understanding. But if an yone, after speculating for hundreds of\\nthousands of lives, does not come to  the point that Kåñëa is the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead and that one has to surrender there, all his speculation\\nfor so many years and lives is a useless waste of time.\\nTEXT  20\\nwiTa GauùTaMa& XaañiMadMau¢&- MaYaaNaga )\\nWTad(bud(ßa buiÖMaaNSYaaTk*-Tak*-TYaê >aarTa )) 20 ))\\niti guhyatamaà çästram\\nidam uktaà mayänagha\\netad buddhvä buddhimän syät\\nkåta-kåtyaç ca bhärata\\nSYNONYMS\\niti—thus; guhya-tamam —the most confidential; çästram —revealed scripture;\\nidam —this; uktam —disclosed; mayä —by Me; anagha —O sinless one;\\netat—this; buddhvä —understanding; buddhi-män —intelligent; syät—one\\nbecomes; kåta-kåtyaù —the most perfect in his endeavors ; ca—and;\\nbhärata —O son of Bharata.\\nTRANSLATION\\nThis is the most confidential part of the Vedic scriptures, O sinless one, and\\nit is disclosed now by Me.

And one should understand this as it is given by the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead. Thus one will become intelligent and perfect in\\ntranscendental knowledge. In other wo rds, by understanding this philosophy\\nof the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engaging in His transcendental\\nservice, everyone can become freed fr om all contaminations of the modes of\\nmaterial nature. Devotional service is a process of spiritual understa nding.\\nWherever devotional service exists, the material contamination cannot\\ncoexist. Devotional service to the Lord  and the Lord Himself are one and the\\nsame because they are spiritual; devotional service takes place within the\\ninternal energy of the Supr eme Lord. The Lord is said to be the sun, and\\nignorance is called darkness. Where the sun is present, there is no question of\\ndarkness. Therefore, whenever devotional service is present under the proper\\nguidance of a bona fide spiritual master, there is no  question of ignorance.\\nEveryone must take to this consciousn ess of Kåñëa and engage in devotional\\nservice to become intelligent and purified. Unless one comes to this position of\\nunderstanding Kåñëa and engages in devo tional service, however intelligent he\\nmay be in the estimati on of some common man, he is not perfectly intelligent.\\nThe word anagha,  by which Arjuna is addressed, is significant. Anagha,  “O\\nsinless one ,” means that unless one is free from  all sinful reactions it is very\\ndifficult to understand Kåñëa. One has to become free from all contamination,\\nall sinful activities; then he can understand. But devotional service is so pure\\nand potent that once one is engaged in devotional service he automatically\\ncomes to the stage of sinlessness .\\nWhile one is performing devotional service in the association of pure\\ndevotees in full Kåñëa consciousness, there are certain things which require to\\nbe vanquished altogether. The most im portant thing one has to surmount is\\nweakness of the heart. The first  falldown is caused by the desire to lord it over\\nmaterial nature. Thus one gives up the transcendental loving service of the\\nSupreme Lord. The second weakness of th e heart is that as one increases the\\npropensity to lord it over material nature, he becomes  attached to matter andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.the possession of matter. The problems of  material existence are due to these\\nweaknesses of the heart. In this chapter the first five verses  describe the\\nprocess of freeing oneself from these we aknesses of heart, and the rest of the\\nchapter, from the sixth verse  through the end, discusses puruñottama-yoga.\\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifteenth Chapter of the Çrémad\\nBhagavad-gétä  in the matter of Puruñottama-yoga,  the Yoga of the Supreme\\nPerson.\\n- CHAPTER 16 -\\nThe Divine And Demoniac Natures\\nTEXTS  1–3\\né[q>aGavaNauvac )\\nA>aYa& SatvSa&éuiÖjaRNaYaaeGaVYaviSQaiTa\" )\\ndaNa& dMaê Yajê SvaDYaaYaSTaPa AaJaRvMa( )) 1 ))\\nAih&Saa SaTYaMa§-aeDaSTYaaGa\" XaaiNTarPaEéuNaMa( )\\n dYaa >aUTaeZvl/aelu/PTv& MaadRv& h \\x81qrcaPal/Ma( )) 2 ))\\nTaeJa\" +aMaa Da*iTa\" XaaEcMad]aehae Naa iTaMaaiNaTaa )\\n>aviNTa SaMPad& dEvqMai>aJaaTaSYa >aarTa )) 3 ))\\nçré-bhagavän uväca\\nabhayaà sattva-saàçuddhir\\njïäna-yoga-vyavasthitiù\\ndänaà damaç ca yajïaç caCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The extra roots comi ng out of it were compared to the\\nactivities of the living entities, some  auspicious, some inauspicious. In the\\nNinth Chapter , also, the devas, or godly, and the asuras,  the ungodly, or\\ndemons, were explained. Now, according to  Vedic rites, activities in the mode\\nof goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation,\\nand such activities are known as daivé prakåti,  trans cendental by nature. Those\\nwho are situated in the transcendental  nature make progress on the path of\\nliberation. For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on\\nthe other hand, there is no possibility  of liberation. Either they will hav e to\\nremain in this material world as huma n beings, or they will descend among the\\nspecies of animals or even lower life forms. In this Sixteenth Chapter  the Lord\\nexplains both the transcendental nature  and its attendant qualities and the\\ndemoniac nature a nd its qualities. He also explains the advantages and\\ndisadvantages of these qualities.\\nThe word abhijätasya  in reference to one born of transcendental qualities\\nor godly tendencies is very significant.  To beget a child in a godly atmosphere\\nis known in the Vedic scriptures as Garbhädhäna-saàskära. If the parents\\nwant a child in the godly qua lities they should follow the ten principles\\nrecommended for the social life of the human being. In Bhagavad-gétä  we have\\nstudied also before that sex life for bege tting a good child is Kåñëa Himself. Sex\\nlife is not condemned, provided the process is used  in Kåñëa consciousness.\\nThose who are in Kåñëa consciousness at  least should not beget children like\\ncats and dogs but should beget them so  that they may become Kåñëa conscious\\nafter birth. That should be the advant age of children born of a father andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.mother absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness.\\nThe social institution known as varëäçrama-dharma —the institution\\ndividing society into four divisions of social life and four occupational\\ndivisions or castes—is not meant to divide human society according to birth.\\nSuch divisions are in terms of educatio nal qualifications. They are to keep the\\nsociety in a state of peace and prosperi ty. The qualities mentioned herein are\\nexplained as transcendental qualities meant for making a person progress in\\nspiritual understanding so that he can get liberated from th e material world.\\nIn the varëäçrama  institution the sannyäsé,  or the person in the renounced\\norder of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of all the social\\nstatuses and orders. A brähmaëa  is considered to be the spiritual master of the\\nthree other sec tions of a society, namely, the kñatriyas,  the vaiçyas  and the\\nçüdras,  but a sannyäsé,  who is on the top of the inst itution, is considered to be\\nthe spiritual master of the brähmaëas  also. For a sannyäsé,  the first\\nqualification should be fearlessness. Bec ause a sannyäsé  has to be alone without\\nany support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the mercy of\\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead.  If one thinks, “After I leave my\\nconnections, who will protect me?” he  should not accept the renounced order\\nof life. One must be fully convinced that Kåñëa or the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead in His localized aspect as Pa ramätmä is always within, that He is\\nseeing everything and He always knows what one intends to do. One must thus\\nh a v e  f i r m  c o n v i c t i o n  t hat Kåñëa as Paramätmä will take care of a soul\\nsurrendered to Him. “I shall never be al one,” one should think. “Even if I live\\nin the darkest regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by Kåñëa, and He will\\ngive me all protection.” That conviction is call ed abhayam,  fearlessness. This\\nstate of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life.\\nThen he has to purify his existence. There are so many rules and\\nregulations to be followed in the renounce d order of life. Most important of all,\\na sannyäsé  is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a\\nwoman. He is even forbidden to talk  with a woman in a secluded place. Lord\\nCaitanya was an ideal sannyäsé,  and when He was at Puré His feminine\\ndevotees could not even come near to offer their respects. They were advised\\nto bow down from a distant place. Th is is not a sign of hatred for wom en as aCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.class, but it is a stricture imposed on the sannyäsé  not to have close\\nconnections with women. One has to follow the rules and regulations of a\\nparticular status of life in order to purify his existence. For a sannyäsé,  intimate\\nrelations with wome n and possession of wealth for sense gratification are\\nstrictly forbidden. The ideal sannyäsé  was Lord Caitanya Himself, and we can\\nlearn from His life that He was very strict in regards to women. Although He is\\nconsidered to be the most liberal incarnatio n of Godhead, accepting the most\\nfallen conditioned souls, He strictly fo llowed the rules and regulations of the\\nsannyäsa  order of life in connection with association with woman. One of His\\npersonal associates, namely Choöa Haridäsa, was associated with Lo rd\\nCaitanya along with His other confiden tial personal associates, but somehow\\nor other this Choöa Haridäsa looked  lustily on a young woman, and Lord\\nCaitanya was so strict that He at once  rejected him from the society of His\\npersonal associates. Lord Cait anya said, “For a sannyäsé  or anyone who is\\naspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate\\nhimself to the spiritual nature and go back home, back to Godhead, for him,\\nlooking toward material possessions and women for sense gra tification—not\\neven enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a propensity—is\\nso condemned that he had better commi t suicide before experiencing such\\nillicit desires.” So these are the processes for purification.\\nThe next item is jïäna-yoga-vyavasthiti:  being engaged in the cultivation of\\nknowledge. Sannyäsé  life is meant for distributing knowledge to the\\nhouseholders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual\\nadvancement. A sannyäsé  is supposed to beg from door to door for his\\nlivelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of\\nthe qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer\\nhumility the sannyäsé  goes from door to door, not exactly for the purpo se of\\nbegging, but to see the householders an d awaken them to Kåñëa consciousness.\\nThis is the duty of a sannyäsé.  If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his\\nspiritual master, he should preach Kåñëa consciousness with logic and\\nunderstanding, and if one is not so advanced he should not accept the\\nrenounced order of life. But even if one has accepted the renounced order of\\nlife without sufficient knowledge, he sh ould engage himself fully in hearingCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowled ge. A sannyäsé,  or one in\\nthe renounced order of life, must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-saàçuddhi\\n(purity) and jïäna-yoga  (knowledge).\\nThe next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The\\nhouseholders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty\\npercent of their income to propagate Kåñëa consciousness all over the world.\\nThus a householder should give in charity to institutional societies that are\\nengaged in that way. Charity should be  given to the right receiver. There are\\ndifferent kinds of charity, as will be explained later on—charity in the modes\\nof goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode  of goodness is\\nrecommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and\\nignorance is not recommended, because it is simply a waste of money. Charity\\nshould be given only to propagate Kåñë a consciousness all over the world. That\\nis charity in  the mode of goodness.\\nThen as far as dama  (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for\\nother orders of religious society, but is especially meant for the householder.\\nAlthough he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life\\nunnecessarily. There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life,\\nwhich should only be engaged in for the propagation of children. If he does not\\nrequire children, he should not enjoy se x life with his wife. Modern society\\nenjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or m ore abominable methods to\\navoid the responsibility of children. This  is not in the transcendental quality,\\nbut is demoniac. If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress\\nin spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child\\nwithout the purpose of serving Kåñëa. If he is able to beget children who will\\nbe in Kåñëa consciousness, one can prod uce hundreds of children, but without\\nthis capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.\\nSacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders, because\\nsacrifices require a large amount of mo ney. Those in other orders of life,\\nnamely brahmacarya, vänaprastha  and sannyäsa,  have no money; they live by\\nbegging. So performance of different  types of sacrifice is meant for the\\nhouseholders. They should perform agni-hotra  sacrifices as enjoined in the\\nVedic literature, but such sacrifices at  the present moment are very expensive,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.and it is not possible for any householder to perform them. The best sacrifice\\nrecommended in this age is called saìkértana-yajïa.  This saìkértana-yajïa,  the\\nchanting of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma,\\nHare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, is the best and most inexpensive\\nsacrifice; everyone can a dopt it and derive benefi t. So these three items,\\nnamely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the\\nhouseholder.\\nThen svädhyäya,  Vedic study, is meant for brahmacarya,  or student life.\\nBrahmacärés  should have no connection with wo men; they should live a life of\\ncelibacy and engage the mind in the stud y of Vedic literature for cultivation of\\nspiritual knowledge. This is called svädhyäya.\\nTapas, or austerity, is especially me ant for the retired life. One should not\\nremain a householder throughout his whol e life; he must always remember that\\nthere are four divisions of life— brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha  and\\nsannyäsa.  So after gåhastha,  householder life, one should retire. If one lives for\\na hundred years, he should spend twenty -five years in student life, twenty-five\\nin householder life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in the\\nrenounced order of life. These are the regulations  of the Vedic religious\\ndiscipline. A man retired from household life must practice austerities of the\\nbody, mind and tongue. That is tapasya.  The entire varëäçrama-dharma  society\\nis meant for tapasya.  Without tapasya,  or austerity, no human being can get\\nliberation. The theory that there is no n eed of austerity in life, that one can go\\non speculating and everything will be nice, is recommended neither in the\\nVedic literature nor in Bhagavad-gétä.  Such theories are manufactured by\\nshow-bottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers. If there are\\nrestrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted. Therefore\\nthose who want followers in the name of  religion, just to have a show only,\\ndon’t restrict the lives of their students, n or their own lives. But that method is\\nnot approved by the Vedas.\\nAs far as the brahminical quality of si mplicity is concerned, not only should\\na particular order of life follow this pr inciple, but every member, be he in the\\nbrahmacäré äçrama, gåhastha äçrama, vänaprastha äçrama  or sannyäsa äçrama.\\nOne should be very sim ple and straightforward.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Ahiàsä  means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One\\nshould not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the\\nkilling of the body there is no harm in  killing animals for sense gratification.\\nPeople are now addicted t o eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply\\nof grains, fruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This\\ninjunction is for everyone. When there is no alternative, one may kill an\\nanimal, but it should be offered in sacrifice. At any rate, when there is an\\nample food supply for humanity, persons who are desiring to make\\nadvancement in spiritual realization sh ould not commit violence to animals.\\nReal ahiàsä  means not checking anyone’s progressive life. The animals are also\\nmaking progre ss in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category\\nof animal life to another. If a particul ar animal is killed, then his progress is\\nchecked. If an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so\\nmany years and is untimely kill ed, then he has to come back again in that form\\nof life to complete the remaining days  in order to be promoted to another\\nspecies of life. So their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one’s\\npalate. This is called ahiàsä.\\nSatyam.  This word means that one should not distort the truth for some\\npersonal interest. In Vedic literature th ere are some difficult passages, but the\\nmeaning or the purpose should be learne d from a bona fide spiritual master.\\nThat is the process for und erstanding the Vedas.  Çruti  means that one should\\nhear from the authority. One should no t construe some interpretation for his\\npersonal interest. There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-gétä  that\\nmisinterpret the original text . The real import of the wo rd should be\\npresented, and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.\\nAkrodha  means to check anger. Even if th ere is provocation one should be\\ntolerant, for once one becomes angry hi s whole body becomes polluted. Anger\\nis a product of the mode of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally\\nsituated should check himself from anger. Apaiçunam  means that one should\\nnot find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily. Of course to call a\\nthief a thief is not faultfinding, but to  call an honest person a thief is very\\nmuch offensive for one who is making advancement in sp iritual life. Hré means\\nt h a t  o n e  s h o u l d  b e  v e r y  m o d e s t  a n d must not perform some act which isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.abominable.

If viol ence is required, they must exhibit it.\\nBut a person who is abl e to curb down his enemy may under certain conditions\\nshow forgiveness. He may excuse minor offenses.\\nÇaucam  means cleanliness, not only in mi nd and body but in one’s dealings\\nalso. It is especially meant for the me rcantile people, who should not deal in\\nthe black market. Näti-mänitä,  not expecting honor, applies to the çüdras,  the\\nworker class, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the\\nlowest of the four classes. They sh ould not be puffed up with unnecessary\\nprestige or honor and should remain in their own status. It is the duty of the\\nçüdras  to offer respect to the higher class for t he upkeep of the social order.\\nAll these twenty-six qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities.\\nThey should be cultivated according to  the different statuses of social and\\noccupational order. The purport is that even though material conditions are\\nmiserable, if these qualitie s are developed by practice, by all classes of men,\\nthen gradually it is possible to rise to  the highest platform of transcendental\\nrealization.\\nTEXT  4\\ndM>aae dPaaeR_i>aMaaNaê §-aeDa\" PaaåZYaMaev c )\\nAjaNa& cai>aJaaTaSYa PaaQaR SaMPadMaaSaurqMa( )) 4 ))\\ndambho darpo ’bhimänaç ca\\nkrodhaù päruñyam eva ca\\najïänaà cäbhijätasya\\npärtha sampadam äsurémCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Therefore he was not\\nof the quality of the demons. For a kñatriya,  a military man, shooting arrows at\\nthe enemy is considered transcendental, and refrai ning from such a duty is\\ndemoniac.

Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them.\\nPURPORT\\nIn every civilized human society there is some set of scriptural rules and\\nregulations which is followed from the beginning. Especially among the\\nÄryans, those who adopt the Vedic civilization and who are known as the most\\nadvanced civilized peoples, those  who do not follow the scriptural injunctions\\nare supposed to be demons. Therefore it is  stated here that the demons do not\\nknow the scriptural rules, nor do they  have any inclination to follow them.\\nMost of them do not know them , and even if some of them know, they have\\nnot the tendency to follow them. They ha ve no faith, nor are they willing to\\nact in terms of the Vedic injunction s. The demons are not clean, either\\nexternally or internally. One should always be careful to keep his body cleanCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.by bathing, b rushing teeth, shaving, changing clothes, etc. As far as internal\\ncleanliness is concerned, one should always remember the holy names of God\\nand chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma,\\nHare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. The demons ne ither like nor follow all\\nthese rules for external and internal cleanliness.\\nAs for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human\\nbehavior, such as the Manu-saàhitä,  which is the law of the human race. Even\\nup to today, those who are Hindu follow the Manu-saàhitä.  Laws of\\ninheritance and other legalities are derived from this book. Now, in the\\nManu-saàhitä  it is clearly stated that a wo man should not be given freedom.\\nThat does not mean that women are to be kept as slaves, but they are like\\nchildren. Children are not given freedom , but that does not mean that they\\nare kept as slaves. The demons have now neglected such injunctions, and they\\nthink that women should be given as mu ch freedom as men. However, this has\\nnot improved the social condition of the world. Actually, a woman should be\\ngiven protection at every stage  of life. She should be given protection by the\\nfather in her younger days, by the husb and in her youth, and by the grownup\\nsons in her old age. This is proper  social behavior according to the\\nManu-saàhitä.  But modern education has artificially devised a p uffed-up\\nconcept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is practically now an\\nimagination in human society. Nor is the moral condition of woman very good\\nnow. The demons, therefore, do not acce pt any instruction which is good for\\nsociety, and because they  do not follow the experience of great sages and the\\nrules and regulations laid down by the sages, the social condition of the\\ndemoniac people is very miserable.\\nTEXT  8\\nASaTYaMaPa[iTaï& Tae JaGadahurNaqìrMa( )\\nAParSParSaM>aUTa& ik-MaNYaTk-aMahETauk-Ma( )) 8 ))\\nasatyam apratiñöhaà te\\njagad ähur anéçvaramCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

There is no cause\\nand effect, no controller, no purpose: ev erything is unreal. They say that this\\ncosmic manifestation arises due to chan ce material actions and reactions. They\\ndo not think that the wo rld was created by God for a certain purpose. They\\nhave their own theory: that the world has come about in its own way and that\\nthere is no reason to believe that there is a God behind it. For them there is no\\ndifference between spirit and matter, and they  do not accept the Supreme\\nSpirit. Everything is matter only, and the whole cosmos is supposed to be a\\nmass of ignorance. According to them , everything is void, and whatever\\nmanifestation exists is due to our igno rance in perception. They take it for\\ngrant ed that all manifestation of diversity is  a display of ignorance. Just as in a\\ndream we may create so many things which actually have no existence, so\\nwhen we are awake we shall see that everything is simply a dream. But\\nfactually, although the demons say that life is a dream, they are very expert in\\nenjoying this dream. And so, instead of acquiring knowledge, they become\\nmore and more implicated in their dreaml and. They conclude that as a child is\\nsimply the result of sexual intercourse between man and wom an, this world isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

As many living creatures come out from perspiration and from a dead\\nbody with out any cause, the whole living world has come out of the material\\ncombinations of the cosmic manifestation. Therefore material nature is the\\ncause of this manifestation, and there is  no other cause. They do not believe in\\nthe words of Kåñëa in Bhagavad-gé tä: mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate\\nsa-caräcaram.  “Under My direction the whole material world is moving.” In\\nother words, among the demons there is  no perfect knowledge of the creation\\nof the world; every one of them has some particular theory of his own.\\nAccording to them, one interpretation of the scriptures is as good as another,\\nfor they do not believe in a standa rd understanding of the scriptural\\ninjunctions.\\nTEXT  9\\nWTaa& d*iíMaví>Ya NaíaTMaaNaae_LPabuÖYa\" )\\nPa[>avNTYauGa]k-MaaR<a\" +aYaaYa JaGaTaae_ihTaa\" )) 9 ))\\netäà dåñöim avañöabhya\\nnañöätmäno ’lpa-buddhayaù\\nprabhavanty ugra-karmäëaù\\nkñayäya jagato ’hitäù\\nSYNONYMS\\netäm —this; dåñöim —vision; avañöabhya —accepting; nañöa —having lost;\\nätmänaù —themselves; alpa-buddhayaù —the less intelligent;\\nprabhavanti —flourish; ugra-karmäëaù —engaged in painful activities;\\nkñayäya —for destruction; jagataù —of the world; ahitäù —unbeneficia l.\\nTRANSLATION\\nFollowing such conclusions, the demoniac, who are lost to themselves andCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

They have no idea how to\\nbehave toward one another. Animal killing is very prominent amongst\\ndemoniac people. Such people are considered the enemies of the world because\\nultimately they will invent or create something which will bring destruction to\\nall. Indirectly, this verse anticipate s the invention of nuclear weapons, of\\nwhich the whole world is today very proud. At any momen t war may take\\nplace, and these atomic weapons may cr eate havoc.

He is enamored by  the possessions he has already, such as\\nland, family, house and bank balance, an d he is always planning to improve\\nthem. He believes in his own strength, and he does not know that whatever he\\nis gaining is due to his past good deeds. He is given an opportunity to\\naccumulate such things, but he has no conception of past causes. He simply\\nthinks that all his mass of wealth is due to his own endeavor. A demoniac\\nperson believ es in the strength of his pers onal work, not in the law of karma.\\nAccording to the law of karma,  a man takes his birth in a high family, or\\nbecomes rich, or very well educated, or very beautiful because of good work in\\nthe past. The demoniac think that all  these things are accidental and due to\\nthe strength of one’s personal abilit y. They do not sense any arrangement\\nbehind all the varieties of people, beauty and education. Anyone who comes\\ninto competition with such a demoniac man is his enemy. There are m any\\ndemoniac people, and each is enemy to the others. This enmity becomes more\\nand more deep—between persons, th en between families, then between\\nsocieties, and at last between nations. Therefore there is constant strife, war\\nand enmity all over the world.\\nEach demoniac person thinks that he ca n live at the sacrifice of all others.\\nGenerally, a demoniac person thinks of  himself as the Supreme God, and a\\ndemoniac preacher tells his followers: “Why are you seeking God elsewhere?\\nYou are all yourselves God! Wha tever you like, you can do. Don’t believe in\\nGod. Throw away God. God is dead.” These are the demoniac’s preachings.\\nAlthough the demoniac person sees ot hers equally rich and influential, or\\neven more so, he thinks that no one is richer than he and that no one is more\\ninfluential than he. As far as promot ion to the higher planetary system is\\nconcerned, he does not believ e in performing yajïas,  or sacrifices. Demons\\nthink that they will manufacture their own process of yajïa  and prepare some\\nmachine by which they will be able to reach any higher planet. The best\\nexample of such a demoniac man was Rävaëa. He offered a progr am to the\\npeople by which he would prepare a stair case so that anyone could reach the\\nheavenly planets without performing sacr ifices, such as are prescribed in the\\nVedas.  Similarly, in the present age such demoniac men are striving to reachCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The placing of the asuras,  the demons, in the lowest\\nstatus of life is simply another feature of His mercy.

Knowing such rules and regulations, one should\\nact so that he may gradually be elevated.\\nPURPORT\\nAs stated in the Fifteenth Chapter , all the rules and regulations of the\\nVedas  are meant for knowing Kåñëa. If  one understands Kåñëa from the\\nBhagavad-gétä  and becomes situated in Kåñëa consciousness, engaging himself\\nin devotional service, he has reached the highest perfection of knowledge\\noffered by the Vedic literature. Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu made this process\\nvery easy: He asked people simply to chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa\\nKåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare and to\\nengage in the devotional service of the Lord and eat the remnants of foodstuff\\noffered to the Deity. One who is dire ctly engaged in all these devotional\\nactivities is to be understood as havi ng studied all Vedic literature. He has\\ncome to the conclusion perfe ctly. Of course, for the ordinary persons who are\\nnot in Kåñëa consciousness or who are not engaged in devotional service, what\\nis to be done and what is not to be do ne must be decided by the injunctions of\\nthe Vedas.  One should act accordingly, without ar gument. That is called\\nfollowing the principles of çästra,  or scripture. Çästra  is without the fourCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.principal defects that are visible in th e conditioned soul: imperfect senses, the\\npropensity for cheating, certainty of committing mistakes, and certainty o f\\nbeing illusioned. These four principal defe cts in conditioned life disqualify one\\nfrom putting forth rules and regulations. Therefore, the rules and regulations\\nas described in the çästra —being above these defects—are accepted without\\nalteration by all g reat saints, äcäryas  and great souls.\\nIn India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally\\nclassified as two: the impersonalist and the personalist. Both of them, however,\\nlead their lives according to the principles of the Vedas.  Without following the\\nprinciples of the script ures, one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional\\nstage. One who actually, therefore,  understands the purport of the çästras  is\\nconsidered fortunate.\\nIn human society, aversion to the pr inciples of understanding the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead is the cause of  all falldowns. That is the greatest\\noffense of human life. Therefore, mäyä,  the material energy of the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead, is alway s giving us trouble in the shape of the\\nthreefold miseries. This material energy  is constituted of the three modes of\\nmaterial nature. One has to raise hims elf at least to the mode of goodness\\nbefore the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened . Without\\nraising oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in\\nignorance and passion, which are the ca use of demoniac life. Those in the\\nmodes of passion and ignorance deride th e scriptures, deride the holy man, and\\nderide the proper und erstanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They\\ndisobey the instructions of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the\\nregulations of the scriptures. In spit e of hearing the glories of devotional\\nservice, they are not attracted. Thus they ma nufacture their own way of\\nelevation. These are some of the defect s of human society which lead to the\\ndemoniac status of life. If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and\\nbona fide spiritual master, who can lead  one to the path of elevation, to the\\nhigher stage, then one’s life becomes successful.\\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Sixteenth Chapter of the Çrémad\\nBhagavad-gétä  in the matter of the Divine and Demoniac Natures.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The living being is said to be of a\\nparticular faith according to the modes he has acquired.\\nPURPORT\\nEveryone has a particular type of fait h, regardless of what he is. But his\\nfaith is considered good, passionate or ig norant according to the nature he has\\nacquired. Thus, according to his particul ar type of faith, one associates with\\ncertain persons. Now t he real fact is that every living being, as is stated in the\\nFifteenth Chapter , is originally a fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme\\nLord. Therefore one is originally transcendental to all the modes of material\\nnature. But when one forgets his relatio nship with the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead and comes into contact with the material nature in conditional life,Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.he generates his own position by asso ciation with the different varieties of\\nmaterial nature. The resultant ar tificial faith and existence ar e only material.\\nAlthough one may be conducted by some  impression, or some conception of\\nlife, originally he is nirguëa,  or transcendental. Therefore one has to become\\ncleansed of the material contamination that he has acquired, in order to regain\\nhis rela tionship with the Supreme Lord. That  is the only path back without\\nfear: Kåñëa consciousness. If one is situated in Kåñëa consciousness, then that\\npath is guaranteed for his elevation to the perfectional stage. If one does not\\ntake to this path of self-rea lization, then he is surely to be conducted by the\\ninfluence of the modes of nature.\\nThe word çraddhä,  or “faith,” is very significant in this verse. Çraddhä,  or\\nfaith, originally comes out of the mode  of goodness. One’s faith may be in a\\ndemigod or some created God or some me ntal concoction. One’s strong faith is\\nsupposed to be productive  of works of material goodness. But in material\\nconditional life, no works are completely  purified. They are mixed. They are\\nnot in pure goodness. Pure goodness is  transcendental; in purified goodness\\none can understand the real nature of the Supreme Perso nality of Godhead.\\nAs long as one’s faith is not complete ly in purified goodness, the faith is\\nsubject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature. The\\ncontaminated modes of material natu re expand to the heart. Therefore\\naccording to the positi on of the heart in contact with a particular mode of\\nmaterial nature, one’s faith is established.  It should be understood that if one’s\\nheart is in the mode of goodness his faith is also in the mode of goodness. If his\\nheart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode of passion. And if\\nhis heart is in the mode of darkne ss, illusion, his faith is also thus\\ncontaminated. Thus we find different ty pes of faith in this world, and there\\nare different types of religions due to different types of fait h. The real\\nprinciple of religious faith is situated  i n  t h e  m o d e  o f  p u r e  g o o d n e s s ,  b u t\\nbecause the heart is tainted we find diffe rent types of religious principles.

According to scriptural\\ninjunction, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable, but those\\nwho are not very conversa nt with, or faithful to, the scriptural injunctions\\nworship different objects, according to th eir specific situations in the modes of\\nmaterial nature. Those who are situated in goodness generally worship the\\ndemigods. The demigods include Brahmä, Çiva and others such as Indra,\\nCandra and the sun-god. There are various demigods. Those in goodness\\nworship a particular demigod for a particular purpose. Similarly, those who are\\nin the mode of passion worship the de mons. We recall that during the SecondCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.World Wa r a man in Calcutta worshiped Hitl er because thanks to that war he\\nhad amassed a large amount of wealth  by dealing in the black market.\\nSimilarly, those in the modes of passi on and ignorance generally select a\\npowerful man to be God. They think that anyone  can be worshiped as God\\nand that the same results will be obtained.\\nNow, it is clearly described here that  those who are in the mode of passion\\nworship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of ignorance, in\\ndarkness, worship dead spirits. Sometime s people worship at the tomb of some\\ndead man. Sexual service i s  a l s o  c o n s i d e r e d  t o  b e  i n  t h e  m o d e  o f  d a r k n e s s .\\nSimilarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts. We have\\nseen that in India the lower-class people  sometimes go to the forest, and if they\\nhave knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, t hey worship that tree and offer\\nsacrifices. These different kinds of worship are not actually God worship. God\\nworship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness. In\\nthe Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (4.3.23 ) it is said, sattvaà viçuddhaà\\nvasude va-çabditam:  “When a man is situated in pure goodness, he worships\\nVäsudeva.” The purport is that those who are completely purified of the\\nmaterial modes of nature and who are transcendentally situated can worship\\nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead.\\nThe impersonalists are supposed to be si tuated in the mode of goodness, and\\nthey worship five kinds of demigods. They worship the impersonal Viñëu form\\nin the material world, which is known as philosophized Viñëu. Viñëu is the\\nexpansion of the Supreme Pers onality of Godhead, but the impersonalists,\\nbecause they do not ultimately believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\\nimagine that the Viñëu form is just an other aspect of the impersonal Brahman;\\nsimilarly, they imagine that Lord Brahmä is the imperson al form in the\\nmaterial mode of passion. Thus they sometimes describe five kinds of gods that\\nare worshipable, but because they thin k that the actual truth is impersonal\\nBrahman, they dispose of all worshipa ble objects at the ultimate end. In\\nconclusion, t he different qualities of the material modes of nature can be\\npurified through association with persons who are of transcendental nature.\\nTEXTS  5–6Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

All Rights Reserved.PURPORT\\nThere are persons who manufacture mo des of austerity and penance which\\nare not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions. For instance, fasting for some\\nulterior purpose, such as to promote a purely political end, is not mentioned in\\nthe scriptural direction s. The scriptures recommend fasting for spiritual\\nadvancement, not for some political end or social purpose. Persons who take to\\nsuch austerities are, according to Bhagavad-gétä,  certainly demoniac. Their acts\\nare against the scriptural injunctions and are  not beneficial for the people in\\ngeneral. Actually, they act out of prid e, false ego, lust and attachment for\\nmaterial enjoyment. By such activities, not only is the combination of material\\nelements of which the body is constructed disturbed, but also the  Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead Himself living within the body. Such unauthorized\\nfasting or austerities for some politica l end are certainly very disturbing to\\nothers. They are not mentioned in th e Vedic literature. A demoniac person\\nmay think that he can  force his enemy or other parties to comply with his\\ndesire by this method, but sometimes one dies by such fasting. These acts are\\nnot approved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He says that those\\nwho engage in them are demons. Such demonstrations  are insults to the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead because they are enacted in disobedience to\\nthe Vedic scriptural injunctions. The word acetasaù  is significant in this\\nconnection. Persons of normal mental  condition must obey the scriptural\\ninjunctions. T hose who are not in such a po sition neglect and disobey the\\nscriptures and manufacture their own way of austerities and penances. One\\nshould always remember the ultimate end of the demoniac people, as described\\nin the previous chapter . The Lord forces them  to take birth in the wombs of\\ndemoniac persons. Consequently they will live by demoniac principles life\\nafter life without knowing their relati onship with the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead. If, however, such persons are fortunate enough to be guided by a\\nspiritual master who can direct them to the path of Vedic wisdom, they can get\\nout of this entanglement and ultimately achieve the supreme goal.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

This is its only purpose. In the past, great authorities\\nselected those foods that best aid health  and increase life’s duration, such as\\nmilk products, sugar,  rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables. These foods are very\\ndear to those in the mode of goodness.  Some other foods, such as baked corn\\nand molasses, while not very palatable in themselves, can be made pleasant\\nwhen mixed with milk or other foods. They are t hen in the mode of goodness.\\nAll these foods are pure by nature. They  are quite distinct from untouchable\\nthings like meat and liquor. Fa tty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse , have\\nno connection with animal fat obtain ed by slaughter. Animal fat is av ailable in\\nthe form of milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods. Milk, butter, cheese\\nand similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out any need for the\\nkilling of innocent creatures. It is only through brute mentality that this\\nkilling goes on. The civilized method of obtaining needed fat is by milk.\\nSlaughter is the way of subhumans. Pr otein is amply available through split\\npeas, däl, whole wheat, etc.\\nFoods in the mode of passion, which are bitter, too salty, or too hot or\\noverly mixed with red pepper, cause misery by reducing the mucus in the\\nstomach, leading to disease. Foods in the mode of ignorance or darkness are\\nessentially those that are not fres h. Any food cooked more than three hours\\nbefore it is eaten (except prasädam,  food offered to the Lord) is considered to\\nbe in the mode of darkness. Because th ey are decomposing, such foods give a\\nbad odor, which often attracts people in this mode but repu lses those in the\\nmode of goodness.\\nRemnants of food may be eaten only wh en they are part of a meal that was\\nfirst offered to the Supreme Lord or first eaten by saintly persons, especially\\nthe spiritual master. Otherwise the remnan ts of food are considered to be inCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.the mode of darkness, and they increase infection or disease. Such foodstuffs,\\nalthough very palatable to persons in the mode of darkness, are neither liked\\nnor even touched by those in the mode of goodness. The best food is the\\nremnants of what is offered to the Supreme Personalit y of Godhead. In\\nBhagavad-gétä  the Supreme Lord says that He accepts preparations of\\nvegetables, flour and milk when offered with devotion. Patraà puñpaà phalaà\\ntoyam.  Of course, devotion and love are the chief things which the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhe ad accepts. But it is also mentioned that the prasädam\\nshould be prepared in a particular way. Any food prepared by the injunctions\\nof the scripture and offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be\\ntaken even if prepared long, long ago, because suc h food is transcendental.\\nTherefore to make food antiseptic, eatable and palatable for all persons, one\\nshould offer food to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\\nTEXT  11\\nAf-l/ak-ax(i+ai>aYaRjae iviDad*íae Ya wJYaTae )\\nYaíVYaMaeveiTa MaNa\" SaMaaDaaYa Sa Saaitvk-\" )) 11 ))\\naphaläkäìkñibhir yajïo\\nvidhi-diñöo ya ijyate\\nyañöavyam eveti manaù\\nsamädhäya sa sättvikaù\\nSYNONYMS\\naphala-äkäìkñibhiù —by those devoid of desire for result; yajïaù —sacrifice;\\nvidhi-diñöaù —according to the direction of scripture; yaù—which; ijyate —is\\nperformed; yañöavyam —must be performed; eva—certainly; iti—thus;\\nmanaù —mind; samädhäya —fixing; saù—it; sättvikaù —in the mode of\\ngoodness.\\nTRANSLATIONCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

These three symbolic representations\\nwere used by brähmaëas while chantin g the hymns of the Vedas and during\\nsacrifices for the satisfaction of the  Supreme.\\nPURPORT\\nIt has been explained that penance, sa crifice, charity and foods are divided\\ninto three categories: the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. But\\nwhether first class, second class or third class, they are all conditioned,\\ncontaminated by the material m odes of nature. When they are aimed at the\\nSupreme— oà tat sat,  the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal—they\\nbecome means for spiritual elevation. In the scriptural injunctions such an\\nobjective is indicated. These three words, oà tat sat,  particula rly indicate the\\nAbsolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Vedic hymns, the\\nword oà is always found.\\nOne who acts without following the re gulations of the scriptures will not\\nattain the Absolute Truth. He will ge t some temporary result, but not the\\nultimate end of life. The conclusion is that the performance of charity,\\nsacrifice and penance must be done in the mode of goodness. Performed in the\\nmode of passion or ignorance, they are certainly inferior in quality. The three\\nwords oà tat sat  are uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the Supreme\\nLord, e.g., oà tad viñëoù.  Whenever a Vedic hymn or the h o l y  n a m e  o f  t h e\\nSupreme Lord is uttered, oà is added. This is the indication of Vedic\\nliterature. These three words are taken from Vedic hymns. Oà ity etad\\nbrahmaëo nediñöhaà näma  (Åg Veda ) indicates the first goal. Then tat tvam asi\\n(Chändogya Upaniñad  6.8.7) indicates the second goal. And sad eva saumya\\n(Chändogya Upaniñad  6.2.1) indicates the third goal. Combined they become\\noà tat sat.  Formerly when Brahmä, the first created living entity, performed\\nsacrifices, he indicated by these three words the Sup reme Personality of\\nGodhead. Therefore the same principle has always been followed by disciplicCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.succession. So this hymn has great significance. Bhagavad-gétä  recommends,\\ntherefore, that any work done should be done for oà tat sat,  or for the\\nSupreme Perso nality of Godhead. When one performs penance, charity and\\nsacrifice with these three words, he is acting in Kåñëa consciousness. Kåñëa\\nconsciousness is a scientific executio n of transcendental activities which\\nenables one to return home, back to Godhead.

In all such activities  it is recommended that one vibrate oà tat\\nsat. The words sad-bhäve  and sädhu-bhäve  indicate the transcendental\\nsituation.

The\\nEighteenth Chapter is a supplementary summarization of the topics discussed\\nbefore. In every chapter of Bhagavad-gétä,  Lord Kåñëa stresses that devotional\\nservice unto the Supreme Personalit y of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life.\\nThis same point is summarized in the Eighteenth Chapter as the most\\nconfidential path of knowledge. In th e first six chapters, stress was given to\\ndevotional service: yoginäm api sarveñäà . .. “Of all yogés  or tran scendentalists,\\none who always thinks of Me within hims elf is best.” In the next six chapters,\\npure devotional service and its nature an d activity were discussed. In the third\\nsix chapters, knowledge, renunciation, the activities of material nature and\\ntranscendental nature, and devotional service were described. It was\\nconcluded that all acts should be perf ormed in conjunction with the Supreme\\nLord, represented by the words oà tat sat,  which indicate Viñëu, the Supreme\\nPerson. The third part of Bhagavad-gé tä has shown that devotional service, and\\nnothing else, is the ultimate purpose of life. This has been established by citing\\npast äcäryas  and the Brahma-sütra,  the Vedänta-sütra.  Certain impersonalists\\nconsider themselves to have a monopoly on the knowledg e of Vedänta-sütra,\\nbut actually the Vedänta-sütra  is meant for understanding devotional service,\\nfor the Lord Himself is the composer of the Vedänta-sütra  and He is its\\nknower. That is described in the Fifteenth Chapter . In every scripture, every\\nVeda,  devotional service is the objective. That is explained in Bhagavad-gétä.\\nAs in the Second Chapter  a synopsis of the whole subject matter was\\ndescribed, in the Eighteenth Chapter also the summary of all instruction isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Yet he has some\\ndoubts, and doubts are always compared to demons. He therefore addresses\\nKåñëa as Keçé-niñüdana.

There\\nare many purificatory processes for advancing a human being to spiritual life.\\nThe marriage ceremony, for example, is  considered to be one of these\\nsacrifices. It is called viväha-ya jïa. Should a sannyäsé,  who is in the renounced\\norder of life and who has given up his family relations, encourage the marriage\\nceremony? The Lord says here that an y sacrifice which is meant for human\\nwelfare should never be given up. Viväha-yajïa,  the mar riage ceremony, is\\nmeant to regulate the human mind so that  it may become peaceful for spiritual\\nadvancement. For most men, this viväha-yajïa  should be encouraged even by\\npersons in the renounced order of life. Sannyäsés  should never associate with\\nwomen, but that does not mean that one who is in the lower stages of life, a\\nyoung man, should not accept a wife in the marriage ceremony.

The Lord is citing Vedänta  philosophy to show\\nhow this is possible. He says  that there are five causes for all activities, and for\\nsuccess in all activity one should consider these five causes. Säìkhya  means the\\nstalk of knowledge, and Vedänta  is the final stalk of knowledge accepted by all\\nleading äcäryas.  Even Çaìkara accepts Vedänta-sütra  as such.

Eña hi\\ndrañöä srañöä  (Praçna Up aniñad  4.9). It is also confirmed in the Vedänta-sütra\\nby the verses jïo ’ta eva  (2.3.18 ) and kartä çästrärthavattvät  (2.3.33 ). The\\ninstruments of action are the senses, and by the senses the soul acts in various\\nways. For each and every action there is a different endeavor.

As already discussed\\nin previous verses, the duties of a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya  and çüdra  are\\nprescribed according to their particular modes of nature. One should not\\nimitate another’s duty. A man  who is by nature attracted to the kind of work\\ndone by çüdras  should not artificially claim to be a brähmaëa,  although he may\\nhave been born into a brähmaëa  family. In this way one should work according\\nto his own nature; no work is abominable, if perform ed in the service of the\\nSupreme Lord. The occupational duty of a brähmaëa  is certainly in the mode\\nof goodness, but if a person is not by nature in the mode of goodness, he should\\nnot imitate the occupational duty of a brähmaëa.  For a kñatriya,  or\\nadminis trator, there are so many abominable things; a kñatriya  has to be\\nviolent to kill his enemies, and sometimes a kñatriya  has to tell lies for the sake\\nof diplomacy. Such violence and duplic ity accompany political affairs, but a\\nkñatriya  is not supposed to g ive up his occupational duty and try to perform the\\nduties of a brähmaëa.\\nOne should act to satisfy the Suprem e Lord. For example, Arjuna was a\\nkñatriya.  He was hesitating to fight the other party. But if such fighting is\\nperformed for the sake of Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there\\nneed be no fear of degradation. I n the business field also, sometimes a\\nmerchant has to tell so many lies to make a profit. If he does not do so, there\\ncan be no profit. Sometimes a merchant says, “Oh, my dear customer, for you I\\nam making no profit,” but one should know that without prof it the merchant\\ncannot exist. Therefore it should be ta ken as a simple lie if a merchant says\\nthat he is not making a profit. But the merchant should not think that because\\nhe is engaged in an occupation in whic h the telling of lies is compulsory, he\\nshoul d give up his profession and pursue the profession of a brähmaëa.  That isCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.not recommended. Whether one is a kñatriya,  a vaiçya,  or a çüdra  doesn’t\\nmatter, if he serves, by his work, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even\\nbrähmaëas,  who perform different types of sacrifice, sometimes must kill\\nanimals because sometimes animals ar e sacrificed in such ceremonies.\\nSimilarly, if a kñatriya  engaged in his own occupation kills an enemy, there is\\nno sin incurred. In the Third Chap ter these matters have been clear ly and\\nelaborately explained; every man should work for the purpose of Yajïa, or for\\nViñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhea d. Anything done for personal sense\\ngratification is a cause of bondage. The conclusion is that everyone should be\\nengaged accordin g to the particular mode of nature he has acquired, and he\\nshould decide to work only to serve the supreme cause of the Supreme Lord.\\nTEXT  48\\nSahJa& k-MaR k-aENTaeYa SadaezMaiPa Na TYaJaeTa( )\\nSavaRrM>aa ih daeze<a DaUMaeNaaiGanirvav*Taa\" )) 48 ))\\nsaha-jaà karma kaunteya\\nsa-doñam api na tyajet\\nsarvärambhä hi doñeëa\\ndhümenägnir ivävåtäù\\nSYNONYMS\\nsaha-jam —born simultaneously; karma —work; kaunteya —O son of Kunté;\\nsa-doñam —with fault; api—although; na—never; tyajet —one should give up;\\nsarva-ärambhäù —all ventures; hi—certainly; doñeëa —with fault;\\ndhümena —with smoke; agniù —fire; iva—as; ävåtäù —covered.\\nTRANSLATION\\nEvery endeavor is covered by some fault , just as fire is covered by smoke.\\nTherefore one should not give up the work born of his nature, O son of Kunté,\\neven if such work is full of fault.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.PURPORT\\nIn conditioned life, all work is co ntaminated by the material modes of\\nnature. Even if one is a brähmaëa,  he has to perform sacrifices in which animal\\nkilling is necessary. Similarly, a kñatriya,  however pious he may be, has to fight\\nenemies. He cannot avo id it. Similarly, a merchant, however pious he may be,\\nmust sometimes hide his profit to stay in business, or he may sometimes have to\\ndo business on the black market. These things are necessary; one cannot avoid\\nthem. Similarly, even though a man is a çüdra serving a bad master, he has to\\ncarry out the order of the master, even though it should not be done. Despite\\nthese flaws, one should continue to carry  out his prescribed duties, for they are\\nborn out of his own nature.\\nA very nice example is given herein. Although fire is pure, still there is\\nsmoke. Yet smoke does not make the fire  impure. Even though there is smoke\\nin the fire, fire is still considered to be  the purest of all elements. If one prefers\\nto give up the work  of a kñatriya  and take up the occupation of a brähmaëa,  he\\nis not assured that in the occupation of a brähmaëa  there are no unpleasant\\nduties. One may then conclude that in the material world no one can be\\ncompletely free from the contamination of materia l nature. This example of\\nfire and smoke is very appropriate in th is connection. When in wintertime one\\ntakes a stone from the fire, sometimes sm oke disturbs the eyes and other parts\\nof the body, but still one must make  use of the fire despite disturbing\\nconditions. Similarly, one should not give up his natural occupation because\\nthere are some disturbing elements. Rather, one should be determined to serve\\nthe Supreme Lord by his occupational duty in Kåñëa consciousness. That is the\\nperfectional point. When  a particular type of occupation is performed for the\\nsatisfaction of the Supreme Lord, all the defects in that particular occupation\\nare purified. When the results of wo rk are purified, when connected with\\ndevotional service, one becomes perfect in seeing  the self within, and that is\\nself-realization.\\nTEXT  49Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

The person acting  in Kåñëa consciousness is really a\\nsannyäsé,  one in the renounced order of life. By such a mentality, one is\\nsatisfied because he is actually acting for the Supreme.

But for th e personalist, or pure devotee, one has\\nto go still further, to become engaged in pure devotional service. This means\\nthat one who is engage d in pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord is\\nalready in a state of liberation, called brahma-bhüta,  oneness with the\\nAbsolute. Without being one with th e Supreme, the Absolute, one cannot\\nrender service unto Him. In th e absolute conception, there is  no difference\\nbetween the served and the servitor; yet the distinction is there, in a higher\\nspiritual sense.\\nIn the material concept of life, wh en one works for sense gratification,\\nthere is misery, but in the absolute world, when one is engaged in pure\\ndevotional service, there is no misery . The devotee in Kåñëa consciousness has\\nnothing for which to lament or d esire. Since God is full, a living entity who is\\nengaged in God’s service, in Kåñëa cons ciousness, becomes also full in himself.\\nHe is just like a river cleansed of all dirty water. Because a pure devotee has no\\nthought other than Kåñëa, he is naturally al ways joyful. He does not lament for\\nany material loss or aspire for gain, becaus e he is full in the service of the Lord.\\nHe has no desire for material enjoymen t, because he knows that every living\\nentity is a fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore\\neternally a servant. He does not see, in  the material world, someone as higher\\nand someone as lower; higher and lower positions are ephemeral, and a devotee\\nhas nothing to do with ephemeral appearances or disappearances. For him\\nstone and gol d are of equal value. This is the brahma-bhüta  stage, and this stage\\nis attained very easily by the pure devo tee. In that stage of existence, the idea\\nof becoming one with the Supreme Brahman and annihilating one’s\\nindividuality becomes hellish, the idea o f attaining the heavenly kingdom\\nbecomes phantasmagoria, and the senses  are like serpents’ teeth that areCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Such knowledge is never vanquished, even after liberation.\\nLiberation involves getting free from the concept of material life; in spiritual\\nlife the same distinction is there, the same individuality is there, but in pure\\nKåñëa consciousness. One should not mistakenly think that the word viçate,\\n“enters into Me,” supports the monist theory that one becomes homogeneous\\nwith the impersonal Brahman. No. Viçate  means that one can enter into t he\\nabode of the Supreme Lord in one’s indi viduality to engage in His association\\nand render service unto Him. For instan ce, a green bird enters a green tree not\\nto become one with the tree but to enjo y the fruits of the tree. impersonalists\\ngenerally give the example of a river flowing into the ocean and merging. This\\nmay be a source of happiness for the im personalist, but the personalist keeps\\nhis personal individuality like an aquati c in the ocean. We find so many living\\nentities within the ocean, if we g o deep. Surface acquaintance with the ocean\\nis not sufficient; one must have comple te knowledge of the aquatics living in\\nthe ocean depths.\\nBecause of his pure devotional serv ice, a devotee can understand the\\ntranscendental qualities and the opulence s of the Supreme Lord in truth. As it\\nis stated in the Eleventh Chapter , only by devotional service can one\\nunderstand. The same is confirmed here ; one can understand the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead by devotional service and enter into His kingdom.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.After attainment of the brahma-bhüta  stage of freedom from material\\nconceptions, devotional service begins by one’s hearing about the Lord. When\\none hears about the Supreme Lord, automatically the brahma-bhüta  stage\\ndevelops, and material contamination—gre ediness and lust for sense\\nenjoyment—disappears. As lust and desires disappear from the heart of a\\ndevotee, he becomes more attached to the service of the Lord, and by such\\nattachment he becomes free from material  contamination. In that state of life\\nhe ca n understand the Supreme Lord. This is the statement of\\nÇrémad-Bhägavatam  also. After liberation the process of bhakti,  or\\ntranscendental service, continues. The Vedänta-sütra  (4.1.12 ) confirms this:\\nä-präyaëät taträpi hi dåñöam.  This means that after libe ration the process of\\ndevotional service continues. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam,  real devotional\\nliberation is defined as the reinstatem ent of the living entity in his own\\nidentity, his own constitutional position. The constitutional position is already\\nexpla ined: every living entity is a part-a nd-parcel fragmental portion of the\\nSupreme Lord. Therefore his constituti onal position is to serve. After\\nliberation, this service is never stopped.  Actual liberation is getting free from\\nmisconceptions of life.\\nTEXT  56\\nSavRk-MaaR<YaiPa Sada ku-vaR<aae MaÜyPaaé[Ya\" )\\nMaTPa[SaadadvaPanaeiTa XaaìTa& PadMaVYaYaMa( )) 56 ))\\nsarva-karmäëy api sadä\\nkurväëo mad-vyapäçrayaù\\nmat-prasädäd aväpnoti\\nçäçvataà padam avyayam\\nSYNONYMS\\nsarva —all; karmäëi —activities; api—although; sadä—always;\\nkurväëaù —performing; mat-vyapäçrayaù —under My protection;Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

A servan t acting on behalf of the supreme master is\\nunaffected by profit and loss. He simply discharges his duty faithfully in terms\\nof the order of the Lord. Now, one may argue that Arjuna was acting under\\nthe personal direction of Kåñë a but when Kåñëa is not pre sent how should one\\nact? If one acts according to the dire ction of Kåñëa in this book, as well as\\nunder the guidance of the representative of Kåñëa, then the result will be the\\nsame. The Sanskrit word mat-paraù  is very important in this verse. It indicates\\nthat one has no goal in life save and except acting in Kåñëa consciousness just\\nto satisfy Kåñëa. And while working in that way, one should think of Kåñëa\\nonly: “I have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by Kåñëa.” While\\nacting in such a way , one naturally has to think of Kåñëa. This is perfect Kåñëa\\nconsciousness. One should, however, note that after doing something\\nwhimsically he should not offer the resu lt to the Supreme Lord. That sort of\\nduty is not in the devotional service of Kåñëa con sciousness. One should act\\naccording to the order of Kåñëa. This is  a very important point. That order of\\nKåñëa comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master.\\nTherefore the spiritual master’s orde r should be taken as the prime duty  of life.\\nIf one gets a bona fide spiritual master and acts according to his direction, then\\none’s perfection of life in Kåñëa consciousness is guaranteed.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

Lord Kåñëa instructed that the\\nindividual is not all in all. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, or He\\nHimself, Kåñëa, as the localized Sup ersoul, sits in the heart directing the living\\nbeing. After changing bodies, the living entity forgets his past deeds, but the\\nSupersoul, as the knower of the past, present and future, remains the witness\\nof all his activities. Therefore all the activities  of living entities are directed by\\nthis Supersoul. The living entity gets what he deserves and is carried by the\\nmaterial body, which is created in the material energy under the direction of\\nthe Supersoul. As soon as a living  entity is placed in a particu lar type of body,\\nhe has to work under the spell of that bodily situation. A person seated in a\\nhigh-speed motorcar goes faster than one seated in a slower car, though the\\nliving entities, the drivers, may be the same. Similarly, by the order of the\\nSuprem e Soul, material nature fashions a part icular type of body to a particular\\ntype of living entity so that he may work according to his past desires. The\\nliving entity is not independent. One should not think himself independent of\\nthe Supreme Personality of  Godhead. The individual is always under the\\nLord’s control.

By such surrender, not only will\\none be released from all miseries in this life, bu t at the end he will reach the\\nSupreme God. The transcendental world is described in the Vedic literature\\n(Åg Veda  1.22.20 ) as tad viñëoù paramaà padam.

Now, in summarizing Bhagavad-gétä,  the Lord says that Arjuna should\\ngive up all the processes that have been explained to him; he  should simply\\nsurrender to Kåñëa. That surrender wi ll save him from all kinds of sinful\\nreactions, for the Lord personally promises to protect him.\\nIn the Seventh Chapter  it was said that only one who has become free from\\nall sinful reactions can take to the wors hip of Lord Kåñëa. Thus one may think\\nthat unless he is free from all sinf ul reactions he cannot take to the\\nsurrendering process. To such do ubts it is here said that  even if one is not free\\nfrom all sinful reactions, simply by th e process of surrendering to Çré Kåñëa he\\nis automatically freed. There is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from\\nsinful reactions. One should unhesitatingly  accept Kåñëa as the supreme saviorCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.of all living entities. With faith and love, one should surrender unto Him.\\nThe process of surrender to Kåñëa is described in the Hari-bhakti-viläsa\\n(11.676 ):\\nänukülyasya saìkalpaù\\nprätikülyasya varjanam\\nrakñiñyatéti viçväso\\ngoptåtve varanaà tathä\\nätma-nikñepa-kärpaëye\\nñaò-vidhä çaraëägatiù\\nAccording to the devotional proce ss, one should simply accept such\\nreligious principles that will lead ultima tely to the devotional service of the\\nLord. One may perform a particular o ccupational duty according to his\\nposition in the social order, but if by  executing his duty one does not come to\\nthe point of Kåñëa consciousness, all hi s activities are in vain. Anything that\\ndoes not lead to the perfectional stage of Kåñëa consciousness should be\\navoided. One should be confiden t that in all circumstances Kåñ ëa will protect\\nhim from all difficulties. There is no n eed of thinking how one should keep the\\nbody and soul together. Kåñëa will see to  that. One should always think himself\\nhelpless and should consider Kåñëa the only basis for his progress in life. As\\nsoon as one seriously engages himself in devotional service to the Lord in full\\nKåñëa consciousness, at once he be comes freed from all contamination of\\nmaterial nature. There are different processes of religion and purificatory\\nprocesses by cultivation of k nowledge, meditation in the mystic yoga system,\\netc., but one who surrenders unto Kåñë a does not have to execute so many\\nmethods. That simple surrender unto Kåñëa will save him from unnecessarily\\nwasting time. One can thus make all progress at once and be freed from all\\nsinful reactions.\\nOne should be attracted by the beautifu l vision of Kåñëa. His name is Kåñëa\\nbecause He is all-attractive. One who becomes attracted by the beautiful,\\nall-powerful, omnipotent vision of Kåñëa is fortunate. There are different\\nkinds of transcendentalists—som e of them are attached to the impersonal\\nBrahman vision, some of them are attrac ted by the Supersoul feature, etc., butCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.one who is attracted to the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead, and, above all, one who is attracted by the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead as Kåñëa Himself, is the most  perfect transcendentalist. In other\\nwords, devotional service to Kåñëa, in full consciousness, is the most\\nconfidential part of knowledge, an d this is the essence of the whole\\nBhagavad-gétä.

He is meant for\\nself-discipline. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu says that the actual position of the\\nliving entity is that of eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Forgetting this\\nprinciple, the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature, but in\\nserving the Supreme Lord he becomes th e liberated servant of God. The living\\nentity’s constitutional position is to be a servit or; he has to serve either the\\nillusory mäyä  or the Supreme Lord. If he serves the Supreme Lord he is in his\\nnormal condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory, external energy, then\\ncertainly he will be in bondage. In illusion the living entity is serving in this\\nmaterial world. He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of himself as\\nthe master of the world. This is called i llusion. When a person is liberated, his\\nillusion is over, and he voluntarily surrenders unto the Supreme to act\\naccor ding to His desires. The last illusion, the last snare of mäyä  to trap the\\nliving entity, is the proposition that he is God. The living entity thinks that he\\nis no longer a conditioned soul, but God. He is so unintelligent that he does\\nnot think that if he  were God, then how could he  be in doubt? That he does\\nnot consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become free from\\nthe illusory energy is to understa nd Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead, and agree to act according to His order .\\nThe word moha  is very important in this verse. Moha  refers to that which is\\nopposed to knowledge. Actually real  knowledge is the understanding thatCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.every living being is eternally a servit or of the Lord, but instead of thinking\\noneself in that position, th e living entity thinks that  he is not a servant, that\\nhe is the master of this material world, for he wants to lord it over the material\\nnature. That is his illusion. This illusi on can be overcome by the mercy of the\\nLord or by the mercy of a pure devotee.  When that illusion is over, one agrees\\nto act in Kåñëa consciousness.\\nKåñëa consciousness is acting according to Kåñëa’s order. A conditioned\\nsoul, illusioned by the external ener gy of matter, does not know that the\\nSupreme Lord is the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor\\nof everything. Whatever He desir es He can bestow upon His devotees; He is\\nthe friend of everyone, and He is especia lly inclined to His devotee. He is the\\ncontroller of this material nature and of all living entities. He is also the\\ncontroller of inexhaustible time, and He is full of all opulences and all\\npotencies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can even give Himself to the\\ndevotee. One who does not know Him is under the spell of illusion; he does\\nnot become a devotee, but a servitor of mäyä.  Arjuna, however, after hearing\\nBhagavad-gé tä from the Supreme Personality of  Godhead, became free from all\\nillusion. He could understand that Kå ñëa was not only his friend but the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. And he understood Kåñëa factually. So to\\nstudy Bhagavad-gétä  is to understand Kåñëa fa ctually. When a person is in full\\nknowledge, he naturally surrenders to Kåñëa. When Arjuna understood that it\\nwas Kåñëa’s plan to reduce the unnecessa ry increase of population, he agreed\\nto fight according to Kåñëa’s desire. He again took up his weapons—hi s arrows\\nand bow—to fight under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\\nTEXT  74\\nSaÅYa ovac )\\nwTYah& vaSaudevSYa PaaQaRSYa c MahaTMaNa\" )\\nSa&vadiMaMaMaé[aEzMad(>auTa& raeMahzR<aMa( )) 74 ))\\nsaïjaya uväca\\nity ahaà väsudevasyaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l.

When  the spiritual master is bona fide,\\nthen one can hear Bhagavad-gétä  directly, as Arjuna heard it.  There are many\\nmystics and yogés  all over the world, but Kåñëa is the master of all yoga systems.\\nKåñëa’s instruction is explicitly stated in Bhagavad-gétä —surrender unto\\nKåñëa.

That is my opinion.\\nPURPORT\\nThe Bhagavad-gétä  began with an inquiry of Dhåtaräñöra’s. He was hopeful\\nof the victory of his sons, assisted by  great warriors like Bhéñma, Droëa and\\nKarëa. He was hopeful that the vict ory would be on his side. But after\\ndescribing the scene on the battle field, Saïjaya told the King, “You are\\nthinking of victory, but my opinion is that where Kåñëa and Arjuna are\\npresent, there will be all good fortune.” He directly confirmed that Dhåtaräñöra\\ncould not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for th e side of Arjuna\\nbecause Kåñëa was there. Kåñëa’s accept ance of the post of charioteer for\\nArjuna was an exhibition of another opulence. Kåñëa is full of all opulences,\\nand renunciation is one of them. There are many instances of such\\nrenunciation, for Kåñ ëa is also the master of renunciation.\\nThe fight was actually between Duryod hana and Yudhiñöhira. Arjuna was\\nfighting on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhiñöhira. Because Kåñëa and Arjuna\\nwere on the side of Yudhiñöhira, Yudh iñöhira’s victory was certain. The battle\\nwas to decide who would rule  the world, and Saïjaya predicted that the power\\nwould be transferred to Yudhiñöhira. It is also predicted here that Yudhiñöhira,\\nafter gaining victory in this battle, wo uld flourish more and more because not\\nonly was he righteous and pious but he was also  a strict moralist. He never\\nspoke a lie during his life.\\nThere are many less intelligent persons who take Bhagavad-gétä  t o  b e  a\\ndiscussion of topics between two friends on a battlefield. But such a book\\ncannot be scripture. Some may protest that Kåñëa incited Arjuna to fight,\\nwhich is immoral, but the reality of  the situation is clearly stated:\\nBhagavad-gétä  is the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction\\nof morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse :\\nman-manä bhava mad-bhaktaù.  One must become a devotee of Kåñëa, and the\\nessence of all religion is to surrender unto Kåñëa ( sarva-dharmän parityajyaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja ). The instructions of Bhagavad-gétä  constitute the\\nsupreme process of religion and of morality. All other processes may be\\npurifying and may lead to this pr ocess, but the last instruction of the Gétä is\\nthe last word in all morality and religion: surrender unto Kåñëa. This is the\\nverdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.\\nFrom Bhagavad-gétä  we can understand that to realize oneself by\\nphilosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully\\nsurrender unto Kåñëa is the highest pe rfection. This is the essence of the\\nteachings of Bhagavad-gétä.  The path of regu lative principles according to the\\norders of social life and according to th e different courses of religion may be a\\nconfidential path of knowledge. But although the rituals of religion are\\nconfidential, meditation and cult ivation of knowledge are still mo re\\nconfidential. And surrender unto Kåñëa in devotional service in full Kåñëa\\nconsciousness is the most confidential in struction. That is the essence of the\\nEighteenth Chapter.\\nAnother feature of Bhagavad-gétä  is that the actual truth is the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead, Kåñëa. The Absolute Truth is realized in three\\nfeatures—impersonal Brahman, localized Paramätmä, and ultimately the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Perf ect knowledge of the Absolute\\nTruth means perfect knowledge of Kåñëa.  If one understands Kåñëa, then all\\nthe departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding.\\nKåñëa is transcendental, for He is a lways situated in His eternal internal\\npotency. The living entities are manifested of His energy and are divided into\\ntwo classes, eternally conditioned and et ernally liberated. Such living entities\\nare innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts of Kåñëa.\\nMaterial energy is manifested i nto twenty-four divisions. The creation is\\neffected by eternal time, and it is cr eated and dissolved by external energy.\\nThis manifestation of the cosmic wo rld repeatedly becomes visible and\\ninvisible.\\nIn Bhagavad-gétä  five principal subject matters have been discussed: the\\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, material  nature, the living entities, eternal\\ntime and all kinds of activities. All is  dependent on the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead, Kåñëa. All conc eptions of the Absolute Truth—impersonalCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\\'l. All Rights Reserved.Brahman, localized Paramätmä and any other transcendental\\nconception—exist within the category of understanding the Supreme\\nPersonality of Godhead. Although su perficially the Supreme Personality of\\nGodhead, the livi ng entity, material nature and time appear to be different,\\nnothing is different from the Supreme.  But the Supreme is always different\\nfrom everything. Lord Caitanya’s philosop hy is that of “inconceivable oneness\\nand difference.” This system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of\\nthe Absolute Truth.\\nThe living entity in his original positi on is pure spirit. He is just like an\\natomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. Thus Lord Kåñëa may be compared to\\nthe sun, and the living entities to suns hine. Because the living entities are the\\nmarginal energy of Kåñ ëa, they have a tendency to be in contact either with\\nthe material energy or with the spiritual energy. In other words, the living\\nentity is situated between the two energi es of the Lord, and because he belongs\\nto the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By\\nproper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of Kåñëa.\\nThus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency.\\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighteenth Chapter of the Çrémad\\nBhagavad-gétä  in the matter of its Conclusion—the Perfection of Renunciation.Bhagavad-gita As It Is , translated with purports by \\nHis Divine Grace A.C.

This task has been \\ncompleted with a view to publish the translations of the Holy \\nQur\\'an in numerous languages following the same pattern. \\nTo begin with, the Nazarat Nashro Isha\\'at, Qadian has \\nprepared a soft-copy of the English translation of the Holy \\nQur\\'an by Hazrat Maulavi Sher Ali Sahib (ra), along with the original Arabic text. \\nMr. Quraishi Mohammad Fazlullah Sahib had the honour \\nof conducting the checking and final reading of the \\nArabic text, diligently comparing it with the original. Similarly, \\nMr. Qureshi Naeem ul Haque performed the significant \\ntasks of incorporating corrections and undertaking the final \\ntypesetting of the Arabic text. Mr. Nooruddin Noori, Mr. Ahmad \\nSadiq Rather, Mr. Waseem Ahmed Azeem and Mr. Mohammad \\nArif Rabbani also rendered their joint efforts in proofreading \\nthe English text of the translation. \\nMr. Ahsan Ghouri, Mr. \\nK.

Foreword \\nIn 2004 we published, under the auspices of I:-Ja<)rat Mirza \\nMasroor A]:imad, Khalifatul Mas1]:i V\"t, the Royal Size of the Holy \\nQur\\'an translated into English by I:Ia<)rat Maulaw1 Sher \\'Ali with \\nthe alternative translation of, and footnotes to, some of the verses \\nby I:Ia<)rat Mirza Tahir A]:imad, Khalifatul Mas1]:i IVrh_ It should \\nbe noted that the original translation of I:Ia<)rat Maulaw1 Sher \\'Ali \\nwas not changed and the translation and notes by I:Ia<)rat Mirza \\nTahir A]:imad, Khalffatul Mas1]:i IVrh, were both given below the \\nrelevant pages of the text and translation with asterisks. We are \\nagain privileged to publish this Royal Size edition in hardcover. \\nIn this edition we have corrected the English names of the \\nSurahs according to the system of transliteration approved by \\nI:-Ja<)rat Khanfatul Mas1]:i yai_ \\nWe pray and hope that this new edition would find a large \\ncirculation especially among those who suffer from Islamophobia \\nand do not hesitate to raise objections against the Word of Allah, \\nHis Propheea and Islam. \\nI:Ia<)rat Mirza Ghulam A]:imad of Qadian, the Promised \\nMessiah and Mahdi\"\\', addressing the entire world, says: \\n\"Whenever Islam has been confronted with any other religion \\nin consequence of some new condition of the age, the sharp and \\neffective instrument that has immediately come to hand is the Holy \\nQur\\'an. In the same way, whenever philosophic thought has been \\ngiven publicity in opposition to it, the Holy Qur\\'an has destroyed \\nthat poisonous plant and has so humiliated it as to provide a \\nmirror to its students which shows up the true philosophy which is \\ncontained in the Holy Qur\\'an alone and nowhere else.\" \\n(lziila-e-Auhiim, Ruhiinz Khazii\\'in, Vol. 3, p. 382) \\n(The Essence of Islam, Vol. I, p.355) \\n<S> \\n(See details of transliteration on page \\'p\\'). \"I call Allah to witness that the Holy Qur\\'an is a rare pearl. \\nIts outside is light and its inside is light and its above is light and \\nits below is light and there is light in every word of it. .. It has been \\ndisclosed to me in a vision that the garden of holiness is irrigated \\nby the water of the Qur\\'an, which is a surging ocean of the water \\nof life. He who drinks from it, comes to life; indeed, he brings \\nothers to life.\" \\n(A \\'zna \\'-e-Kamiiliit-e-!sliim, Riihiinz Khazii \\'in, Vol. 5, pp. 545-546) \\n(The Essence of Islam, Vol. I, p.356) \\nWe owe our gratitude and indebtedness to Munir-ud-Din \\nShams, Additional Wakil-ut-Ta~nif, London, for his relentless help \\nthat he gave us in preparing that edition. We are also grateful to MirzaAnasA]:imad, M.A. M.Litt. (Oxon), Wakil-ul-Isha\\'at, Ta]:irik\\xad\\ne-Jadid, Rabwah and his team at Rabwah for their help in making \\nthis edition ready for publication. May Allah reward them for this \\nabundantly. Amin. \\nThe Publisher \\n<8> \\n(See details of transliteration on page \\'p\\'). Foreword \\nThe English translation of The Holy Qur\\'an by the late I:Ia<_lrat MaulawI \\nSher \\'An (may Allah be pleased with him) was first published in Holland in \\n1955 and since then many editions have been published in different countries. \\nIn 1997 Islam International Publications Ltd. issued a new edition with an \\nappendix containing alternative translations of some verses, or parts of verses, \\nas well as explanatory notes to some of them by f:Ia<_lrat Mirza Tahir A]:imad, \\nthe fourth successor of the Promised Messiah (may Allah bless his soul with \\nHis infinite mercy). In the present edition we have dropped the appendix and \\nbrought the material under relevant verses marking them with starlets*. (The \\nalternative translations by I:Ia<_lrat Mirza Tahir A]:imad are given in bold letters. \\nBut where he has made a deletion in the original translation, no bold letters \\nare used). This, we hope, will facilitate the reader to make full use of these \\nadditions. Starlets are also used to indicate publisher\\'s notes, however, at the \\nend of each such note, \\'publisher\\' is printed in brackets. The symbols \\'t\\', \\':I:\\' \\nindicate the original notes by the translator. \\nThe present project was begun under the instructions of f:Ia<_lrat Mirza \\nTahir A]:imad, the fourth successor of the Promised Messiah and Head of the \\nWorld Wide A]:imadiyya Muslim Jama\\'at (May Allah bless his soul with His \\ninfinite mercy). Before f:Iu<_lur\\'s demise, he constantly guided us and prayed for \\nus; and made some changes in, and additions to, his own translation. After his \\ndemise, f:Ia<_lrat Mirza Masroor A]:imad, Khalffatul MasI]:i the Fifth, has been \\nguiding us and praying for us. Whenever we felt that in the appendix of the \\nold edition some typing mistakes or minor mistakes of punctuation, setting etc. \\nneeded to be corrected, we always sought guidance first from f:Ia<_lrat Khalffatul \\nMasI]:i IV and later from f:Ia<_lrat Khalffatul Mas1]:i V. Only those corrections are \\nincorporated which were approved by I:Ia<_lrat Khal!fatul Mas1]:i IV and later by \\nI:Ia<_lrat Kha!Ifatul MasI]:i V. \\nWe are pleased to record our gratitude and indebtedness to Mun1r-ud\\xad\\nDln Shams, Additional Wak!l-ut-Ta~nff, London, for his relentless help that he \\ngave us in preparing this edition. He was always ready to present our textual \\nand other difficulties to I:Ia<_lrat Kha!Ifatul MasI]:i and seek his guidance on our \\nbehalf. We appreciate his constantly encourging us to bring out this edition as \\nsoon as possible. We cannot, however, overlook to thank the team in Pakistan \\nwho assisted Munfr-ud-Dln Shams in this difficult task. The team was headed \\nby MirzaAnasA]:imad, M.A. M.Litt. (Oxon), Wak!l-ul-Isha\\'at Tahr1k-e-Jad1d, \\nRabwah and included Mirza Lutfur Ra]:iman, Sayyed Man~ur A]:imad Bashir, \\n\\'Az1z-ur-Ra]:iman Khalid, Ashrafis]:iaq, Mubashir A]:imad and Shaikh Na~eer \\nA]:imad who typeset the manuscript and made it camera-ready for publishing; \\nwe very much appreciate his expertise in Desktop Publishing. Last, but not \\nthe least, we are extremely grateful to Chaudhary I:Iamidullah M.A., Wakil\\xad\\nul-A \\'la Ta]:ir1k-e-Jad1d, Rabwah, for his guidance and encouragement to the \\nRabwah team and for his helping it in every possible manner whenever it \\nneeded any assistance from him. \\n<8> \\n(See details of transliteration on page \\'p\\'). In transliterating Arabic words we have followed the following system \\nadopted by the Royal Asiatic Society. \\nat the beginning of a word, pronounced as a, i, u preceded by a very slight \\naspiration, like h in the English word \\'honour\\'. \\nc.\\':.J th, pronounced like th in the English word \\'thing\\'. \\nC ~\\' a guttural aspirate, stronger than h. \\nt kh, pronounced like the Scotch ch in \\'loch\\'. \\nj dh, pronounced like the English th in \\'that\\'. \\n0\"\\' ,y, strongly articulated s. \\nu-<> q, similar to the English th in \\'this\\' . \\n.b t, strongly articulated palatal t. \\nb ?, strongly articulatedz. \\nt \\', a strong guttural, the pronounciation of which must be learnt by the ear. \\nt gh, a sound approached very nearly in the r \\'grasseye\\' in French, and in \\nthe German r. It requires the muscles of the throat to be in the \\'gargling\\' \\nposition whilst pronouncing it. \\n,j q, a deep guttural k sound. \\n\\', a sort of catch in the voice. \\nShort vowels are represented by a for__,.,._ (like u in \\'bud\\'); i for----;;;-(like i in \\n\\'bid\\'); u for___1__ (like oo in \\'wood\\'); the long vowels by a for-1-orT(like a in \\n\\'father\\'); zfor cS----;;;,-or-1-(likc ee in \\'deep\\'); ai for t5 ___..._ (like i in \\'site\\'); u \\nfor _.,____...L_(like oo in \\'root\\'); au for_., __,.,._(resembling ou in \\'sound\\'). \\nThe consonants not included in the above list have the same phonetic \\nvalue as in the principal languages of Europe. \\nAll praise belongs to Allah to Whom we bow in sincerest gratitude for \\nenabling us to complete this task. \\nThe Publisher \\na i u I I th .::- I /J r I kh f- I dh ; I ~ J\\' <v q ~ I / 1, I • J; I \\' f I gh f I q J I \\' • \\n(See details of transliteration on page \\'p\\').

Thal is why by the end of the verse, \\nthe conclusive declaration is that whatever may have happened they certainly failed to kill \\nhim. This implies that it is not the act of crucifixion which is denied. What is denied is death \\nby crucifixion. \\nWa/iikin shuhhiha /ahum ( ~ 0 ~ ,): the word shuhhiha (0) in the text must be \\ncarefully studied. The context of the preceding text would not permit\\'the implied reference to \\nany other than Jesus or alternatively it could refer to the incident in general. In conformity with \\nthe rules of grammar the implied pronoun in the word shubbiha (0) can refer to none other \\nthan Jesus Christ himself. This means that it was he who was obscured and made to appear to \\nthem similar to someone else. Hence as Jesus was hung upon the cross he hung in the likeness of someone else. Evidently the denial is not that of crucifixion or apparent death thereupon but \\nthe denial is death by crucifixion. There certainly was great confusion as lo what actually had \\nhappened. So the verse continues to build the scenario of the confusion and doubt. All else is \\nnothing but conjecture. Thal is the final conclusion. \\nIf the word shubbiha refers to the incident as such, this would point to the divergent \\nclaims of the two disputing parties as to what had happened. Neither of the parties were certain \\nof the validity of their claims. For instance the Christian belief of Jesus\\' death by crucifixion \\nand later resurrection was not based on any tangible grounds but was merely conjectural. \\nLikewise the Jewish claim of Jesus\\' death upon the cross was no less conjectural. Hence their \\nappeal to Pilate for the possession of Jesus\\' body. In fact they clearly expressed their doubts \\nregarding the entire episode of his so-called death and warned Pilate that in the likelihood of \\nhis survival he might reappear in public claiming that he had risen from the dead. (Matthew \\n27:63-64) \\nTt is to this that the last part of the verse under study refers, when it says wa \\ninnalladh,na (&.i}, \\ni,,). Certainly those who differ about it (or about him as lo what actually \\nbefell him) were themselves in doubt. \\n,:, 159. Note: Bal rafa\\'ahulliihu ilaihi (~),i,\\', Ll; j.;): the majority of orthodox Muslims infer \\nfrom this part of the verse that the connotation of Bal refers to the act of crucifixion i.e., \\ninstead ofletting him die upon the cross, God rescued him by raising him bodily to somewhere \\nin the heavens. As such he should be living somewhere in space in the same corporal form that \\nhe possessed prior to the attempt of his crucifixion. This interpretation raises many difficult \\nquestions, mainly: \\n(a) If Jesus was not crucified at all, is the entire history of crucifixion emphatically \\ndenied and the whole episode just a fiction or delusion suffered by the Jews, the Christians and \\nthe Romans alike\\'\\' \\n(b) Where in the verse is the claim that Jesus was raised bodily lo heavens? All that is \\nmentioned simply is that Allah exalted him to Himself. \\na i u I I th -=, I ~ T I kh r I dh ; I e er Q9 cf J, I ! b I ;, i; I \\' f I gh f I q 3 I \\' \\n(Seedetailsoftransliterationon page \\'p\\').

And there is none among the \\nPeople of the Book but will believe \\nin it before his death; and on the \\nDay of Resurrection, he (Jesus) \\nshall be a witness against them-Chapter 4 - r\\' •Y\\' \\nAs to the first question the orthodox build a fantastic scenario according to which the \\nfact of crucifixion itself is not denied but it is claimed that the person who was crucified was \\nnot Jesus but someone else who was given the likeness of Jesus by some angels at the command \\nof God. Hence the doubts and conjectures were about the identity of the person who was \\ncrucified. Evidently this explanation creates only more problems than it solves. Moreover, the \\nentire tale is absolutely without foundation. No scriptural evidence or evidence based on the \\ntraditions of the Holy Prophet (may peace and blessings of Allah be on him) is ever presented \\nto support this bizarre claim which simply adds more conjectural confusion. \\nTt is as if this explanation of the verse dawned only upon the medieval scholars while \\nthe Messenger of God, peace be upon him, remained himself completely unaware of it. \\nAs to the second question the weakness of the claim is apparent from the wording of \\nthe Holy Qur\\'iin. The word rafa \\'a (;J;) means elevated. Whenever Allah elevates a person the \\nelevation always refers to the status of the person, never to his body. In fact it is impossible to \\ntranslate this verse in any way other than the said meaning i.e., the elevation of spiritual \\nstation. \\nThe verse declares that Allah elevated Jesus to Himself. Evidently no point in space \\nof Heaven is mentioned lo which Allah raised him. He raised him lo Himself while He was \\npresent there where Jesus was. No place in Heaven or earth is empty of Allah\\'s presence. So \\nwhen someone is said lo be raised lo Him, a bodily movement is impossible and inconceivable. \\nAccording to Ahmadiyya understanding of this verse, the connotation of \\'on the contrary\\' \\nrefers to the Jewish claim of the accursed death of Jesus. Obviously the opposite of curse is \\nnearness to God. \\n,:, 160. Note: This verse has been the subject of controversy regarding its real import. Some \\nscholars believe that it refers to a remote future in relation to the time of crucifixion indicating \\nthat all Jews without exception will one day have faith in Jesus Christ and accept him as a true \\nProphet of God. They claim that it is also mentioned in this verse that this miracle would take \\nplace in the lifetime of Jesus Christ. This they infer from the words qahla mautihi (H~ µ) \\nwhich means before his death. \\nAs the Jews have not yet accepted him, therefore, according to such scholars Jesus \\nmust be still alive. \\nAnother commonly held view is that the expression \\'before his death\\' refers to every \\nmember of the Jewish faith of the time of Jesus Christ. In this case this would mean that every \\nJew would believe in Jesus Christ before his death-a claim which can only be verified by \\nGod. \\nUnfortunately many problems and difficulties stand in the way of accepting these \\npropositions in toto. \\nWe propose a completely different and new solution to the problem. The verse under \\nstudy is translated as \\'There is no one among the people of the Book but will certainly believe \\nin him before his death.\" \\nThe word in italics i.e., \\'one\\' is not literally mentioned in the verse but is only implied. \\nIf it were mentioned the verse would mean as follows: \\nwain afiadimmin ahlilkitiibi -,4]1 -J-k\\' 0 ~I\"\"\\' \\na i u I I th -=, I ~ T I kh r I dh ; I e er Q9 cf J, I ! .b I ;, i; I \\' f I gh P- I q 3 I \\' \\n(Seedetailsoftransliterationon page \\'p\\').

We suggest that instead ofA/zadbeing implied \\nwe should consider the wordfar,q (c:;!)) as the implied word. In that case the translation would \\nbe: \"There is no sect or group from among the People of the Book but will have faith in him \\n(Jesus Christ) before his death.\" \\nThis requires that Jesus must have migrated to the lands occupied by the lost tribes of \\nIsrael and in doing so he fulfilled his mission of delivering his message to all the twelve flocks \\nofthe house of Israel. This view is further powerfully supported by a prophecy of Jesus Christ \\nwherein he claimed that he would go in search of the lost sheep of the house ofTsracl.

It will remind mankind that God has created mountains which are essential for \\nproviding food to all living beings. The water is constantly lifted from lakes, seas and oceans by \\nevaporation carried by higher altitude to get condensed into thicker particles. The existence of \\nmountains is essential for turning the vapour into water again, thus producing wide-spread rains \\nwhich are channelled back to earth to create immense food chains. This translation is the only \\none which fits into the context and is in perfect agreement with the remaining part of the verse. \\nThe correct meaning, therefore, would be: \\'He has entrenched mountains over the earth so \\nthat they may provide you with food, and rivers and tracks so that you may be guided.\\' \\nThe relation of waler and food is obvious. In the history of civilisation it was rivers \\nwhich played the most important role in making the mountainous terrains possible and paths \\nwere carved along the courses of rivers. \\na i u I I th -=, I ~ T I kh r I dh ; I e er Q? cf J, I ! b I ;, i; I \\' f I gh P- I q 3 I \\' \\n(Seedetailsoftransliterationon page \\'p\\').

He said, \\'O nobles, which of you will bring me her throne before they come lo me \\noffering submission?\\' \\nNote: From the following verses, it becomes clear that Solomon docs not refer to her throne \\nitself. He either means a throne very similar lo hers should be manufactured or that a very \\nfaithful replica of her throne should be brought to him. Before her intended visit to the court \\nof Solomon, she is given the surprise of finding a throne very similar to her own but in the \\npossession of Solomon. From the verses which follow, the scenario that emerges clearly \\nindicates that each of the nobles of his court wanted the task to be assigned to him, each \\nboasting to perform the task quicker and better than his rivals. Ultimately, when the replica \\nwas first presented to him, he praised God for it and issued instructions to modify it further so \\nthat it might resemble the Queen of Saba\\'s throne ever more closely and so deflate her pride \\nin possessing a unique throne. The expression nakkiru /aha \\'arshaha( •_,jj.< ·-,i ,;;43) clearly \\nsupports this meaning and implies that if she saw a throne very similar to her own, she would \\nnaturally infer that her own throne was not as unique and special as she thought it was. So the \\nmeaning of nakkin, (.;;43) in this context would make her throne seem common-looking. \\nWhen she actually saw the throne built by Solomon\\'s craftsmen, her response was not that of \\na Queen who only recently had her own throne stolen, nor that of a Queen who could not \\nrecognise her own throne because the craftsmen had worked on itto render it unrecognisable. \\nHer response is simply that of a person who finds an article similar to her own. This clearly \\nproves that the scenario we have visualised is more realistic. \\n,:,41.
